Marques Brownlee,YmwskGLycHo,Phone,Apple,"- So this here is my Titanium iPhone 15 Pro that I've been using with no case for 88 days, or about three months now. I wanna do more longer term reviews. Not that three months is a super long time to have a phone, but in the usual smartphone review space, at least, for me, it's one to two weeks with a phone before I'm summarizing everything from my experience and putting it into a review. And so the longer I use a phone, the more I'm able to actually uncover about it, especially about the way I use it. So as someone who carries two phones all the time and the iPhone typically is in my pocket for a long time, I have a lot more stuff for this iPhone. So first things first, I haven't put my phone in a case since the day I bought it. Sometimes I regret this, sometimes I don't. It's pretty rare that I actually drop my phone and this one also hasn't yet been dropped, but it does show some pretty normal signs of wear and tear. But it's nothing too concerning. Like, I always start to get some bigger cuts, like this, on my front display glass because of my refusal to put on a screen protector. And these here aren't any more or less than usual despite, you know, the fancy ceramic shield. But I do really like the switch to titanium for the frame and the side rails around this phone. It looks way better than the stainless steel. It's also lighter and I am also glad I went with this lighter color because this combo seems to show the fewest fingerprints. It looks the cleanest. Overall, though I feel like I'm happy with this spec that I went with. Now, long-term behavior, there are three really interesting things about this phone. Two of them, I feel like I'm using way less than I thought I would and one of them, I'm using basically exactly as much as I thought I would. So first of all, in the camera of the Pro iPhone, this was the first year Apple announced this sort of neat multiple focal lengths feature. So you can hit that 1x button three different times and get three different focal lengths, 24 millimeters, then 28 millimeters, then 35 millimeter focal lengths, all with the same quality. I pretty much never use this feature. I don't know if that means I'm, like, not a true smartphone photographer, but I always just frame things at 1x",0.0,621.843,125.32999999999997
Marques Brownlee,YmwskGLycHo,Phone,Apple,"and that seems to be the end of it for me. So I just don't use that feature, even though our testing does show that it works. But I still think the new button they added to iOS 17, where if you zoom in on a photo, a crop button appears and that actually crops the photo. That's significantly more useful of a feature for me and I actually think for a lot of other people. But then the action button is another one. So this is a pretty big headlining feature on this year's Pro iPhones, this rare ability to actually customize something on your iPhone. So I definitely feel like the UI that they built into the settings is still one of the weirdest most un-Apple-like stapled in pieces of UI I've ever seen them do. But hey, it works, it's great. You can map the button to basically almost anything you want. But a lot of people made a great observation about the placement of this button when the phone first launched, which is, like, the reason that mute switch that we used to have was so great, is 'cause it was sort of tucked up in the corner and out of the way. So you could just never even think about it. Just leave your phone on mute forever and be fine. But Apple is very stubborn about placing this action button in the exact same spot where the mute switch used to be, which does mean it's kind of out of the way. It's a little bit, annoyingly, not very reachable, especially when you use the phone with one hand. So when I first got the phone, I mean, I was going nuts with all the possibilities of the crazy things that I could think of to do with it. First thing I did was map it to Google Assistant, since I never use Siri, but having a quick toggle to the better assistant is hilarious and more useful to me. Then I later briefly switched it to toggle starting a new voice conversation with ChatGPT. So the ChatGPT chatbot has its own voice and you can have a voice conversation with it and it's really cool, but it isn't the most useful thing in the world. Like, it's cool that it can do complex math and reasoning and generate new things for you, but then it can't see your calendar or tell you the weather or do anything current events related. So that didn't last long. So then I switched to starting a new dialogue box for a new task in my to-do list app of choice, TickTick,",125.43,621.843,118.38000000000001
Marques Brownlee,YmwskGLycHo,Phone,Apple,"and this one's pretty cool. You hit the button and it literally opens a text box and you just start typing a new task. Really, really nice if you just happen to remember something somewhere. But I also totally still have the muscle memory to just go home and open the app whenever I need it. I also have a lock screen task to do that. So it was a little bit redundant for me. So I've ended up with my action button just being set to open the camera and that's the fastest, most convenient way to get to the camera for me. Yes, there is a lock screen shortcut also, but I just find that if I am doing something and I just need to quickly get a picture of something that's happening or something's about to go away, I don't wanna miss it. Like, I just have this muscle memory now to just hit that button and just take the photo. You can actually have it open to take a selfie or take some other types of photos or videos. I just have it open to viewfinder and I'm good. So then, of course, USB Type-C was the biggest headlining feature of this newest generation of iPhones, hilariously enough. Slow USB 2.0 speeds on the base iPhone 15, but then USB 3.2 speeds on the 15 Pro and Pro Max, which makes a pretty big difference when importing tons of ProRes footage, even if it isn't Thunderbolt speeds yet. First of all, thank you, Europe, it's about damn time. Even as someone who is a pretty heavy wireless charger user, I do have to say, it is much nicer. It's been great to just have one cable to charge almost everything from this iPhone to any Android phone to the iPad Pro to my laptop. But unfortunately, I have not been able to get rid of my lightning cable just yet because there are still other things in my ecosystem, in Apple's ecosystem, that haven't switched to USB-C quite yet. Mostly because AirPods Max is my headphones for traveling of choice and I still have to carry the lightning cable everywhere just to charge those. But there's also still the Magic keyboard and the Apple Magic Trackpad. I really don't know how long it's gonna take Apple to go through and also update all of these things to be USB Type-C, but I guess my lightning cables are sticking around a little while longer until they refresh all that stuff. The AirPods Max came out at the end of 2020,",243.81,621.843,123.42
Marques Brownlee,YmwskGLycHo,Phone,Apple,"so word on the street is they may be due for a refresh sometime soon, but we don't know. Definitely get subscribed to see the review of the new ones whenever they do come out, but as of right now, they're still lightning. So there have been several software updates to the iPhone 15 lineup since it came out. It launched on iOS 17, which made all types of headlines, but then we've already made it to iOS 17.2. The new Journal app is live now, which I have a few friends that use, but I don't use it. There's, of course, been a bunch of bug fixes and optimizations since we heard about, you know, the Instagram app and those random heat problems. Those seem to also be fixed and gone. And there's also a curious new little button in the camera app. So if you go to Settings and then Camera and then under Formats, there's a new toggle to be able to record spatial video for the Apple Vision Pro. So things seem to be lining up interestingly for the Vision Pro to actually launch sometime in January or February, which should be pretty cool. And if you remember watching that one demo of spatial videos on the Vision Pro, yes, you can record them on the headset, which looks hilarious, but you can also record them on an iPhone, specifically only on an iPhone 15 or 15 Pro so far because of the horizontal alignment of the main and ultra-wide cameras. So if you go into the camera app with that new check toggled, in video, there's a little headset icon, and if I select that, I'm now shooting that special spatial video, which means a few things. First of all, you must turn your iPhone sideways to landscape because your eyes are next to each other and not on top of each other. And it also will limit you to 1080p 30fps because it's actually processing two streams of video at once, one from the primary camera that you can see, but then the other one from the ultra-wide camera for your other eye. So you can go crazy right now and just go out and start shooting a bunch of spatial videos on your iPhone. But if you go watch them on your phone, they will look just like normal videos because it's only gonna play back the video from the main camera. If you wanna see and appreciate the spatialness of the video, you will need an Apple Vision Pro. Now, I've actually gotten to experience the App Vision Pro",367.23,621.843,121.67999999999999
Marques Brownlee,YmwskGLycHo,Phone,Apple,"a few more times since that initial preview video that I did from Apple Park, flex, I know. But what I've actually gotten to do with it is shoot a bunch of my own spatial videos and then watch them back on the headset. And the main thing I really learned is they look okay. I think the dramatic part is, like, when you get the subject within two, three, four feet of the camera, then it's, like, really dramatic, kind of like a 3D movie. Then you see things popping out at you. So Pro tip, if you're gonna take a bunch of spatial videos now, that's the sweet spot for it to actually be worth it. Oh, and also, another Pro tip, it took me months to learn this, but if you ever have anything happening on the Dynamic Island, you can swipe across it to hide it or change the view style, in case you're annoyed by, like, a train ticket or an Uber delivery that's taken up space up there or something you just don't wanna see up there anymore. So go ahead and swipe, the more you know. So clearly, you don't have to upgrade your phone every year or every two years or very often at all. But the more I use this phone, the 15 Pro, the more I'm confident that this is one of the good years to upgrade, from the updated cameras to the USB Type-C to the titanium. Like, there's the concept of an upgrade sweet spot, and I feel like this phone hit it, especially for people with much older iPhones. So I'll leave you with this. In the original iPhone 15 Pro Review, I compared this phone to the Porsche 911 in that the design doesn't really change a whole lot from generation to generation. They, instead, spend a really long time refining and honing in on a slightly better version of the same thing. So I just turned 30 recently. Still weird saying that out loud, but for my 30th birthday, I decided to take that plunge too. Yes, it is matte black, but I can now say that once you start living with a 911, you actually appreciate that strategy just a little bit more. It is not flashy, it's not dramatic, it's boring, it's predictable, it's familiar, confidence inspiring. Also, this entire video, every single shot was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys on the next one, peace. (bright upbeat music)",488.91,621.843,132.93299999999996
Marques Brownlee,0X0Jm8QValY,Phone,Apple,"(upbeat music) - All right, so this is Apple's brand new, latest and greatest iPhone 15. And nothing inside is new or anything that we haven't seen before in some other phone somewhere. Now that doesn't mean it's not a good phone. You can actually be a really good phone and not really new, they aren't mutually exclusive. And it turns out, that is actually Apple's strategy with this phone. The more I use this phone, the more I see Apple's textbook, late mover advantage strategy coming into play here. They're gonna take something we've literally already seen before and then do it the Apple way. So on the outside, let's see, how would I describe this new phone's design? Kind of familiar, I don't know, somewhat reminiscent of the 14. How does Apple say it? - iPhone 15 has an all new design that's simply gorgeous. - All new? All new? Really? Okay, I mean, I don't know about all new but this phone definitely inherits the same looks and general design as last year again. But you know what's at least partially new is actually the way it feels in the hand. So I said this in the 15 Pro review, but they've done a good job softening the corners here. So it still looks boxy, still has aluminum rails, but it's more comfortable to hold, since these corners aren't as sharp, they're a little bit rounded off. And then, this is also the first glass-backed, non-Pro iPhone with a satin back, and I am loving the satin back, this is like a nice, soft touch, frosted glass back here. I know there's a super complicated process too to like get this single piece of glass on the back to be two different colors and two different thicknesses and all that, and I can totally respect it. But honestly, the colors, they are super weak. People were saying in the last video the the color grading must be off, it looks like it's white instead of blue. No, this blue phone really doesn't look that blue at all in almost any lighting, it's like 1% blue. But either way, you can say between the aluminum and the pale light colors, these are also probably the most fingerprint resistant iPhones in years. On the sides, same button placements, same speakers placements, same mute switch, no action button on this phone. Honestly, you could probably use an iPhone 14 case on the iPhone 15. But around the front, new screen, well, not new, again, but new to this iPhone, new screen. You now get the dynamic island on the non-Pro iPhones this year, which is very much doing the whole punch cutout the Apple way. So the notch is finally dead until maybe a new iPhone SE brings it back, it could happen. But also, slowly, app developers have been getting on board",1.156,621.843,161.81000000000003
Marques Brownlee,0X0Jm8QValY,Phone,Apple,"in useful ways over the past year. I already have a few favorites now, my airline app's giving me real-time flight info, my weather apps, Uber, et cetera. But while we're up here talking about the screen on this phone, it's also brighter, It's up to 2,000 knits now, which looks awesome outdoors. But also, it's 2023, and this is an $800 phone that still has a 60 hertz display. This is actually really fascinating to me. It's so odd. Like, on one hand, for most people buying this phone, it's totally fine. It literally doesn't have, it's a new baseline iPhone, have you talked to someone who buys a new baseline iPhone? They literally don't care. It doesn't matter, it's not something they pay attention to, you could ask them right now how many frames per second their phone is and they wouldn't have an answer, just doesn't matter. So just as long as it works and it's all relatively smooth like last year and the year before and the year before, it's totally a non-factor. I have actually literally handed 120 hertz phone to people next to a 60 hertz phone, and even side by side next to each other, they can't see the difference. Or if they do, it's just like, oh, that's a subtle thing that seems kind of neat but they'd be totally fine missing out on it. So with the target demographic of this phone, it's totally fine. But on the other hand, Apple, the richest technology company in the world, does stuff all the time that regular people will literally never notice, that are subtle improvements or changes here and there, all the time. Like, when they switched these baseline iPhones from LCD to OLED displays, do you think any of these people actually noticed that? Or what about going from the A15 Bionic last year to this A16 Bionic? Do you think people are actually noticing the differences here? Or what about when they just added 5G to the iPhone and most people didn't care? Like, making subtle improvements over time is what modern smartphones are all about these days. And I would actually argue that a higher refresh rate is more noticeable to more people than some of those other things. Like, I think you could today hand me, a professional, an unlabeled iPhone with an A15 Bionic and an A16 Bionic, and it would take me quite some time to find the real differences between them. And so, that combined with the fact that it's incredibly cheap and easy and reasonable to get to like at least a 90 hertz phone, isn't the new Moto G is like 90 hertz at $170 or something like that? Now I'm sure that's a horrible looking screen compared to this iPhone, it's 720P with the brightness of a box of crayons. But still they decided to add that to that phone because Motorola knew that enough people would notice it and feel that smoothness difference",175.32,621.843,157.40700000000007
Marques Brownlee,0X0Jm8QValY,Phone,Apple,"and it's a higher level of perceived performance. So it's just wild to me, knowing how easy it would be for Apple to make this even a 90 hertz display, but they just refuse to do it because they've attached the word Pro to that feature. It's promotion for the Pro phones. And it just strikes me as a tool just to sort of continue widening the gap as much as they can between the Pro iPhones and the non-Pro iPhones, and they're happy to do it, even if it makes this iPhone 15 the most expensive phone in the world with a 60 hertz display. Anyway, speaking of widening that gap, the Pro phones this year also got a brand new A17 Pro chip but this iPhone 15 gets last year's A16 Bionic from the 14 Pro. Honestly, the renaming of the Pro chip might be the most interesting part because it implies that it's definitely not going to trickle down to the baseline phone next year. But either way, this A16 bionic here is more than good enough in a phone of this price, as far as performance and handling everyday tasks and gaming and flying around iOS at 60 hertz. And the one thing you definitely can argue for 60 hertz would be battery life, because despite all the issues floating around, the battery life on these phones has been pretty good. So I don't know if you saw it, but Apple has officially now addressed the heat and battery issues that some people, including myself, have been reporting with these iPhones. So an iOS update is coming and it seems like some specific third party apps, like Instagram, were also having issues and those should be getting updates too. But on average, the battery life on my 15 has been better than my battery on the 15 Pro. And the 15 Plus looks to have the best battery life ever on any iPhone, which is really promising. So that combination of the A16 Bionic, which is not new, and 60 hertz screens, which are not new, are giving you great battery life. Also, USB-C is definitely not new but here it is alongside all the benefits that come with it, from using the same cable to charge everything, to plugging into more accessories, like monitors and keyboards and all kinds of other stuff. It is sad that the older chip does mean there's no USB 3 controller so there are no USB 3 data speeds, it's still slow, but honestly, unless you're using the Pro iPhone's camera features, there's almost nobody here buying this phone that's gonna actually need fast data transfer anyway so I guess you can give it a pass. And they managed to do it in the Apple way too. They color matched the inside of the USB-C port with the color of the phone, and they actually, I don't know if you've seen this, they print the model number inside the port. So Apple really loves hiding this in the most discreet way possible. You know, I should really gives some appreciation to some of the clever software features on the iPhone 15 because you could actually consider them new.",336.42,621.843,161.00999999999993
Marques Brownlee,0X0Jm8QValY,Phone,Apple,"So they added stuff like an ultra-wideband chip so you can find your phone more easily with an Apple Watch or be found on Find My Friends, that's new. They also added these clever audio effects and video effects at an OS level, so they work inside of any app. So you can be on a phone call or a video call or a Google Meet or Zoom or whatever, and flip on the background noise cancellation and it works really shockingly well, it's very, very good. So I'm on a phone call with myself, this is what it'll sound like to be in a room with the dishwasher running, the HVAC going, and the sink going right next to me, right next to the microphone. When I switch the mic from Standard mode to Voice Isolation mode, even though all the same noises are still happening, it does a much better job of just picking out specifically my voice, really smart and it's genuinely new. There's also some other not so new stuff, like they just now added downloadable offline areas to Apple Maps and interactable widgets, and they finally added an 80% battery charge limiter in the settings. So you can check out all this stuff, I did a full video on the iOS 17 update at the link below that like button, if you wanna watch that, you should definitely check it out after you watch this video. What I will say is one of the most liked features I talked about in that video is Standby mode. And on the Pro iPhone, when you put it on a charger, turn it sideways, it keeps the screen on which it can do because it goes to one Hertz, it's an LTPO display, and it's fine staying on like that. But on the non-Pro iPhone, which does not have LTPO, it's basically locked at I think either 30 or 60 hertz, either way it doesn't drop to one Hertz. So Apple just decides, we'll turn off the screen after a little bit, which kind of feels like it defeats the purpose of this feature, so then you have to nudge the table or or bump the stand to wake it up like an Apple Watch charger. Just a notable difference between the Pro and non-Pro iPhones. But last but not least, these new cameras are actually weird, but in a good way. So iPhone 15 has been upgraded to a new set of 12 megapixel ultra wide and the new 48 megapixel main camera. It's not the same sensor as the Pro, it's actually slightly smaller, but it has a larger max aperture of F1.6 to make up for it. And then, it's also doing a combo of binning and detailed transfer to give you this new 24 megapixel photo as a result by default. Now, if you were paying attention before, you'll remember that this new iPhone has the exact same chip as last year's Pro iPhone. Same processing cores, same image signal processor, same neural engine, same A16 Bionic, same everything. So why is this new 24 megapixel default only coming to the newest iPhone 15 and not last year's Pro? Like, I still have last year's Pro phone and I've updated it to the latest software",497.43,621.843,166.356
Marques Brownlee,0X0Jm8QValY,Phone,Apple,"and it does not get this feature, it's still shooting 12 megapixels. So honestly now my base iPhone 15's non-zoomed in photos are actually looking a little better, a little more detailed than last year's Pro phones. And then, there's the new auto-Portrait Mode detection feature, which is pretty sweet. Basically you don't have to switch to Portrait Mode to take a photo that captures all of the depth information that allows you to turn it into a Portrait Mode photo later. So as long as you're pointing the camera at a human subject or a cat or a dog as identified by the neural engine, or if you tap to focus, you automatically get this little F at the bottom corner of the screen, which means it's capturing the data needed for Portrait Mode, just in case. And so, then, later, if you decide, eh, I actually do want this to be a Portrait Mode shot, you go into your gallery and just make it a Portrait Mode photo, that you can even then go in and edit and play with. Some people have been describing it as being able to change the focus point later. It's not exactly doing that, you can't like save something that was out of focus by bringing it back. But basically, for the classic iPhone shot where it kind of looks like everything is in focus, then, yeah, you can play with Portrait Mode and get really good results. Last year's Pro iPhone has the same chip, also has a 48 megapixel main camera and has the same neural engine, doesn't get this feature, for some reason. Also kind of weird. So look, with these reviews, we always make a lot of judgements about what we think the typical iPhone buyer is, what they actually care about, what they'll notice, what they will appreciate about a new phone. And with this one, I do feel like they've stacked up enough of these subtle improvements, that even though it looks the same and there's not really that much that's actually new here, they've at least stacked enough things that it feels like an appreciably better phone. So my verdict is, if you have an iPhone 14, you don't have to upgrade, of course, even a 13 maybe. But if you have an older phone and you're looking to upgrade to a new iPhone, every year, I always get friends asking like, ""Oh, should I just get the older, like last year's iPhone to save some money?"" And no, I actually wouldn't, I would say just get the iPhone 15. There's enough new changes here, it's a better phone in every way and it's also USB. Like, you don't buy a base iPhone to get the bleeding edge of tech, you buy it just 'cause it works and it's fine and it's gonna be familiar and work for the next few years. And just knowing that you're gonna have it for the next few years, I would not recommend buying a Lightning iPhone as we just moved everything forward into the world of USB type C. Just get the new one, just grab the boring new iPhone with nothing that's actually that new. It's just gonna work. That's it, thanks for watching, catch you in the next one. Peace.

Marques Brownlee,cBpGq-vDr2Y,Phone,Apple,"- You know what's funny? When there is not that many changes, it really puts a magnifying glass on the few changes that there actually are. Have you ever listened to a car reviewer describe the latest generation Porsche 911? Like, this is a car that's looked more or less the same for the past 50 years with slight evolutions with each new generation. And literally, every time you watch or read a review, they always say every single time, ""Oh, it's so refined, oh, this is an engineering masterpiece that's been perfected over generations. It's a formula that's been developed in the same direction for years."" I actually, as a kid, I used to actively dislike Porsches because I just, I knew they were expensive, but I thought they're all so boring, they all look like the same thing. Why would you get one of those, when you could get a way more exciting Ferrari or McLaren instead? But as I've gotten older, I can appreciate the Porsche formula a little more. I don't love it or anything, I wouldn't say I love it, but I can appreciate it more, does that make sense? I hope that makes sense. ♪ Bling ♪ ♪ I am the one at optimum ♪ ♪ I got the drum, I got the drop on 'em ♪ ♪ I got the lock, stock and barrel on top of them ♪ ♪ I got the chopper for the block they knocking on ♪ ♪ Act tion tion ♪ ♪ Look at the crowd, the way they packed in in ♪ ♪ Lone wolf hear the howl, where the pack then then ♪ ♪ Is he packing then ♪ ♪ Shooting off at the mouth like rat tat tat bling ♪ ♪ Anybody in a pine for life ♪ ♪ Your size ain't nothing for you to die for ♪ ♪ All up in my eye for ♪ This is the iPhone 15 Pro. Not a lot of changes. (logo whooshing) So, okay, I think people gotta get this thought out of their head that you've gotta upgrade every year to the newest phone. Like, I realize most of us already know this, but for some reason, people are still stuck on this thing where they say, ""Oh, last year's phone is barely different from this year's phone, it's not worth upgrading."" But like, that's not new, like the Zenfone 10 I just reviewed is just a refinement of Zenfone 9. Like the bleeding edge ROG phone has looked the same for three years now, the Pixel is finding its stride with design. But what we're really looking for is for them to fix anything that's wrong or bad, and then just find ways, clever ways, good, interesting ways to just get a little bit better every year, so that over a long time, over a bunch of improvements, it adds up to a bigger, more significant change. So that's what's happening here with this iPhone 15 Pro. I've been using it for about two weeks now. They've made some improvements, but now we're starting to also see some possible problems, some new issues that have risen up, so let's talk about it. So there's basically four new features they've added here. I'm gonna go over some of the more fundamental and existential stuff in the regular iPhone 15 review, so definitely make sure you're subscribed to see that when it comes out. But for the Pro, it's time to deep dive on the stuff that's unique to this one, the professional stuff. That being the build, the chip, the cameras and the Action Button. So easiest place to start is the way they've built this phone. So Apple made an update to the build and the materials of the iPhone this year, they've softened the corners a little bit, it's clearly still a boxy design, but, you know, now, instead of a completely flat glass at the front, there's this gentle little curve just at the very edges. I think that'll maybe make screen protectors slightly more intricate, but I think it has a nice look to it. And then the screen sizes are exactly the same, but now the bezels are actually a tiny bit slimmer all the way around. So technically the phone is like one millimeter smaller diagonally and the rails have famously switched from that shiny stainless steel to a lighter, coated and brushed titanium. The result, it's very slightly better, I think. It's kind of funny, I've always associated a heavy phone with like expensive feeling, you know? Like, the ceramic phones are like extra heavy, they feel like substance. But I understand why people want it to be lighter. And so, this phone is actually noticeably lighter than the previous Pro. It's 10% on paper, but it feels like more than 10%. And then, there's a new set of colors too so I'm sticking with it, this new natural titanium is the best color, this is the first year I am not ordering a dark or black iPhone. They still look good, don't get me wrong, but they get all kinds of fingerprints on them like crazy. And also, my worries about the light colored scratches, if you go deep enough, were all confirmed by Zack, JerryRigEverything, in his video cutting the thing up. So because I'm on team no case, I'm going with the all gray phone, I think it looks dope, so I'm going with that. I think basically the idea is, if you have a perfectly working phone, there's no world where you should upgrade to this one just for the titanium build or just for the slightly thinner bezels.",0.327,621.843,277.71000000000015
Marques Brownlee,cBpGq-vDr2Y,Phone,Apple,"But you have to appreciate, put this up next to an iPhone 11, then, yeah, you can see the differences compounding over time. Just like if you sat in a 992 generation 911 right now after sitting in a 997 generation car. But the real highlight of this build here, let's be honest, is there's a new port at the bottom, that USB type C, which makes a big difference to people like me who have other gadgets in their life, computers, headphones, mouse, keyboard, I just bring one charger, it works with everything. I have already had this rite of passage moment that everyone who gets this phone is gonna have where you have an existing Lightning cable and you try to plug it in and then you're like, oh right, new cable. But now I've gotten used to it. But the thing is, I could have sworn Apple would do more with this port. Like, okay, we know that they were basically forced into doing this by the EU, so shout out to the EU for that. Now we have a USB iPhone, but like the only pitch is just, hey, one cable for everything. That's it, Apple really? So like with 30 pin to Lightning all those years ago, the benefit was obvious, it's just so much smaller of a port so that let them fit more stuff in the phone, plus it's reversible now. Now with this USB type C, it's like okay, it was already small, it was already reversible, charging speed did not improve at all, it's still 25 watts. There's no extra like desktop mode, plug it into a monitor and get, there's no decks or anything like that, right? It's just one cable for everything. Okay, fine, sure, welcome to the club. You know, iPhone users can now take advantage of the U in USB-C. I talked about the handshake it does with plugging directly into other phones and reverse charging them at four and a half watts in the unboxing video, that's pretty neat. You can also plug in other things, plug in a keyboard and type with it, plug in a monitor, it'll mirror your screen at up to 4K 60. And the Pro phone now supports USB 3.0 data transfer speeds so you can get that ProRes footage off the phone noticeably faster, and you can actually, for the first time, shoot video directly onto an external drive. Now there's some talk about the cable that comes in the box. Remember that nice high quality braided USB-C cable that comes in the box? But it's only USB 2.0 transfer speeds, it's a slow cable. So if you have a Pro phone, you need get a faster separate cable for it? That seemed weird to people, but it's not, that's very normal. Most smartphones come with just a USB-C cable just to charge. It's a charging cable. If you wanted a data cable, you'd have to buy a thicker, more robust cable that looks the same but is a data cable. It's kind of confusing and annoying actually. Welcome to the world of USB-C, my friends, it's good to have you. But that is a good segue to the main enabler, the new powerhouse chip inside this phone with a new name, the A17 Pro. So the base iPhone 15s got last year's A16 bionic from the 14 Pro. And so, here's this new more powerful chip in the highest end phones and it's not the A17 Bionic, this is the first one with the Pro name, A17 Pro, and this thing goes kind of crazy on paper. This is their first three nanometer chip, actually, the first three nanometer chip in any phone that we'll probably see for at least another year or two. I ran some benchmarks, it's literally approaching M1 chip levels of synthetic benchmark scores, and compared to last year, it's 10 to 20% more powerful on both the CPU and the GPU, which is very respectable. But more power is like more horsepower in a car. It's only really useful or noticeable if it lets you do more things with it. I'm gonna live in this analogy a bit more for a minute, but like the last generation Porsche 911 Turbo S, it was already so ballistic fast that you never approached that limit anywhere on public streets until you get to the highest end of performance, on the track. And the highest end iPhone is the same way, like, the Pro iPhone's been great at just surfing Instagram and texting and doing all the normal web browsing, basic stuff you'd do on a phone. And so, the only place you'd really notice the extra performance is, well, we got a gaming demo. Apple showed these wild demos on the new iPhone at the keynote. And just a disclaimer, I'm not much of a phone gamer so I'll defer the commentary on this to Dave2D, you can go watch his video, linked below. But they literally launched exclusive games on the iPhone, that are like ""Resident Evil: Village"" and ""Assassin's Creed"", but not on cut down mobile versions, these are literally the same versions with the same assets and same textures and everything from the PlayStation version 'cause it literally is the PlayStation version. That's impressive. Plus you know, performance headroom is never a bad thing. But I think also for me and for a lot of other people, the more impactful things that you'll actually notice about this new chip are in the dedicated parts of it that are for specific tasks. Like, the new image signal processor lets you take really, really fast,",287.46,621.843,289.46
Marques Brownlee,cBpGq-vDr2Y,Phone,Apple,"lag-free photos constantly. The new neural engine recognizes Portrait Mode subjects, like people's faces and dogs and cats automatically, and lets you go back in time and set a regular photo to a Portrait Mode photo. The USB 3 controller that enables faster data transfer speeds is also on the A17 Pro, all of that is coming from the new chip. But what I'm more concerned with at the moment is battery life. Okay, so actually, it's kind of two main issues that have been popping up that you kind of have to try to figure out, are they isolated issues or are these real problems with the phone? And those are battery life and overheating issues. And to be honest, part of the reason this review took like longer than normal is I've been really trying to dig into the battery and figure out what's going on here. So objectively speaking, these phones have slightly bigger batteries than last year and a new three nanometer chip. So in a controlled environment, they should do better and they do, they literally last longer on like simple benchmark stuff. So that's good news. Now when I test a phone, like normal, I pretty much, I kind of go by feel, I always have some mix of good days, some average days and then some bad days, where I can sort of figure out what's draining it, what its weaknesses are and then I can come to a conclusion from that. So now here we are, I get a couple days in, I get a couple weeks in and I've had a good amount of average days, I've had a couple of those bad draining days, but I also haven't had any of those amazing days where I get like nine hours of screen on time. I just haven't had any yet. And then, we also started to see some of those headlines about battery life potentially being worse and there's also some overheating issues popping up on Twitter or X and some people were asking if mine has had any issues. So here's the weird answer, yes, but not when I would expect, Two days ago, literally, I was just at a golf tournament, it was in Florida, it was like 100 degree really feel or something crazy like that. And I'm outside with my phone at max brightness with GPS going all day out in the sun, and it was fine, no problem, no overheating issues. But then, a couple hours later, I'm on the airplane with my phone in Airplane Mode and I've got just like music playing on Bluetooth with Spotify and like scrolling through Instagram, and for like five minutes, the phone just gets really hot and just blasts through like 5% battery, and then it's fine again afterwards, and I'm like, there almost seems to be no rhyme or reason why it does this randomly once in a while. So my best theory is that the A17 Pro is just, it's a more powerful chip and so therefore, is able to drain power more quickly than before in high intensity settings, like gaming, et cetera. And there's also been some issues attributed to iOS 17 bugs, like we're already on 17.0.2. I imagine there's some more updates coming to both iOS and a bunch of apps. But by the end of this, I kind of feel like I'm expecting battery life to basically even out to be the same as last year, which is a boring answer, but that's kind of what I expect. Now we can talk all we want about what the word Pro actually means in a smartphone, but with iPhones, that has mostly meant cameras. And it turns out there is a lot going on with these relatively similar looking cameras on these new Pro phones, both in hardware and software. So you're looking at a new bigger 48 megapixel main camera. There's also an improved ultra wide with a closer up macro capability and a whole telephoto situation that we'll get to in a minute. But then with software, there is this whole new intricate image processing pipeline happening. So you know how most smartphones, a lot of 'em today have like 48 megapixel cameras and they all bin down to 12 megapixels. They give you 12 megapixel shots. You know, previous iPhones did this, this new one, for those who might've missed it, is actually by default spitting out 24 megapixel images instead of 12, and it's only about one and a half times of file size. So this new process, which is the same actually across the board for iPhone 15s and 15 Pros, is it's taking a 48 megapixel full sensor shot for detail information and also taking a full sensor 12 megapixel shot, which is the quad binning for light information and noise. And then, it's using the neural net to combine them and do a sort of a detailed transfer to get you this hybrid 24 megapixel image. It's very complicated, very clever, and the end result is slightly better. It's really right in line with what I've been saying. So if you just generally look at photos shot on this camera, it's an iPhone photo, like, they look pretty great, they're awesome with dynamic range and sharpness across the board. I still prefer and shoot in the rich contrast profile most of the time, but, yeah, mostly, the iPhone is one of the best cameras at just pointing and shooting, in full auto, just getting results that look good, even if it doesn't look the most like real life, you know, it's doing the classic relighting and tone mapping and everything we're used to from all this smart HDR, it's all here and a lot of people like it and it looks good. The improved Macro Mode is also really good. And with this natural fall off with the primary camera without even needing Portrait Mode,",578.07,621.843,306.037
Marques Brownlee,cBpGq-vDr2Y,Phone,Apple,"you can get some blurred backgrounds, it's awesome. Autofocus is also really, really fast, especially whenever there's a face in the scene, this thing loves seeing faces. And the benefit of the bigger sensor shows itself at night too with even longer handheld captures. It's not magic, it's just physics, but, you know, does the 24 megapixel make a difference over the 12 megapixel? Well, zoomed out, absolutely not, they look basically the same. So you gotta zoom in, and even at 50% zoom, you still can't really tell. It's not until you zoom all the way in that you can, okay, you can see a difference, you can start to notice a difference in fine detail and contrast. The 15 Pro is definitely, when your pixel peeping, more contrasty and sharp when you're all the way zoomed in versus last year. But that's just when you've zoomed all the way in. And by the way, once you get past 2X zoom, it's back to kicking out regular 12 megapixel images. So again, it's like, it's a small, small year-over-year improvement with that tiny amount of like pixel peeping detail, but over a longer distance, over a bunch of generations, that's the type of thing that adds up. They even, on the Pro phones, did a couple of presets from the 1X lens. There's a 24 millimeter all the way zoomed out, then a 28 millimeter, a little bit tighter, and a 35 millimeter that all have their own dedicated image processing pipeline presets to maximize detail into these basically super res, zoom, focal lengths that you can digitally zoom between. I wouldn't exactly call it having extra lenses on the phone, but, you know, 1.5X zoom on last year's phone versus 1.5X zoom on this year's phone, slight difference. But there is a difference. Honestly, the most Pro things about these new phones though is definitely their video cameras, so I'm just gonna nerd out about these for a second. Because the iPhone's video capabilities, I've talked about this so much, but they're still so clearly far out in front of the rest of the smartphone world. It doesn't even shoot 8K, which it's totally capable of with the 48 megapixels. I wish they would let us, but even just at 4K 30 in full auto, the detail, the auto focus, the slight depth, the dynamic range, the stabilization, they're all world class. I mean, if you wanna just look at test footage, the entire electric Rivian delivery van review I did on the Auto Focus channel was shot on iPhone 15 Pro, audio included, I'll drop the link below if you wanna watch that whole thing. Also, shout out to the new AV1 Codec support on the chip, that's gonna play nice with YouTube. But this year, you can also shoot Log, literally a Pro camera feature. Now it is annoyingly buried several layers deep in the separate Settings app, which is really not very Pro. But if you find the time to go switch over there and get into Log, the iPhone will shoot with way more information, that classic flat Log look, dynamic range, everything. And you don't have to deal with whatever Apple was gonna do with over sharpening and saturation and processing. Apple has its own transformation LUT to turn it into SDR or HDR or you can go in and fully grade it yourself to really get the most out of the iPhone's video and it looks really, like, really, really good. So the one thing that I'm gonna say to, you know, because I'm pixel peeping at this point, is the haloing from point light sources. You know, it's one of the hardest challenges with these tiny optics so I get why they haven't just fixed it yet, but like it's pretty bad. Anytime there's any sort of point lights, especially with video, despite whatever new lens coding they're doing, it's pretty dramatic and it seems like it's the worst on the iPhone of any other phone. So it's there, gonna point it out again, but, hey, if that's the biggest downside of iPhone video, I'll definitely take it. And then, iPhone 15 Pro Max, the big one is the only one that comes with the new 5X larger telephoto lens. I would bet my life that that's gonna come down to the smaller 16 Pro next year, whatever, but it's only in the big one this time. But yeah, it does let you get a little further with max zoom, from 15X to 25X. It's nice if you do a lot of zoomed photos and videos, which is a very specific crowd, there's some people that do that, you know, concert goers, things like that. But there are just very few people who should buy one just for this lens because it also means you have to have a bigger phone and it also happens to mean that your 4X photos just before you get to 5X will actually be worse on this phone. But, yeah, it's not nearly as capable as some of the longer telephoto periscope lens. I mean Samsung has a 10X optical lens that blows this one out the water in terms of reach, I think Apple's main advantage really is just stabilization. Like, they finally do that zoom in preview window on the corner of the viewfinder and they overstabilize the frame, so you can zoom all the way in and get a shot in super creeper mode, it's great. But I'm just gonna shamelessly borrow a line from Mr. Mobile because he said it as well as anyone possibly could, and he's right, which is just that so much of the differences between these cameras, this one, the last iPhone, the Samsungs, the Pixels of the world, so much of the differences between them is software",884.58,621.843,299.49
Marques Brownlee,cBpGq-vDr2Y,Phone,Apple,"that it's hardly even consistent anymore. So if you are looking for like a hard verdict on like iPhone 15 Pro side by side versus Samsung versus Pixel or Oppo, whatever else, you kind of just have to make it up after a while, like, yeah, there are gonna be certain instances, like exact zoom focal lengths where one is sharper than the other, but honestly, at at the end of the day, a lot of it is gonna be taste. And so, yeah, you just kind of have to figure out which one you like as far as image quality and especially UI, just the actual way you shoot photos and videos. Which reminds me, I do wanna mention, this RAW Max button is hilarious. This is a button to take your full res 48 megapixel Pro RAW photos, but it just says RAW Max, okay. And if you want a 48 megapixel JPEG, you have to jump back into the Settings app, switch it over, then bounce back, and now the button says JPEG Max, which is also hilarious. Last thing I gotta say though, this new Pro phone has an Action Button on this new Pro iPhone only because only pros need customization. Look, I kind of love the Action Button, but I also need to realize that it's kind of either overrated or underrated, depending on who you are. Like, on one hand, it's literally a customizable button, like, who even saw this coming? It replaces the least used button that was on previous iPhones because your phone should always be on mute anyway. And so, then, you can map this Action Button to basically anything you want. You can keep it as a mute switch and it has the same strong haptics so you can tell if it's muted or unmuted in your pocket without looking. But there's also a bunch of other cool functions you can pick from, from launching your camera to a voice recorder to just literally any app on your phone you want through a Siri Shortcut. Your favorite YouTube channel right now is probably making a tutorial on the best Siri Shortcuts to map to the Action Button from launching apps, to the specific things inside of apps, from unlocking your car, to not just launching my favorite task manager app, but launching a new task inside of my task manager app. It just lets me, it's great, it's awesome, honestly, I hope it gets copied, even though a bunch of phones were doing this years ago and then they stopped. I hope they bring it back now in a response to how great this is. But on the other hand, I do kind of feel like, for a lot of people, this is gonna be one of those things that they play with for like three or four days and then just kind of forget about it and never use it again. And I mostly think that's because it's not super reachable. Like, it's not a one handable button where your fingers usually rest for everyone, especially on the Pro Max, it's way up there on the corner above the volume buttons. It could be a cool shutter button for the camera, but the volume buttons already do that, so yeah, I feel like you might as well just end up setting it back to a mute switch and forgetting about it after a few weeks. But I guess that's fine too. It's one of those things that you'll just figure out which user you are after you use it for a while. Kinda like I've been using that Eight Sleep mattress cover that I was talking about, I've been using it for about three months now, this is the pod cover that goes on your mattress that either warms you up or cools you down, helps you sleep. Like, now that I've used it for a while, I've understood, like I was a skeptic at first, but honestly, it's one of those things where I go to a hotel bed and I have a harder time sleeping, which it used to be the other way around, but I just sleep so much better in the Eight Sleep bed 'cause it's cooled down to let you get sleep early and then warms up in the morning to help you wake up. And it's become really clear that temperature is one of the most important factors when it comes to sleep, and it's become real obvious to me that falling asleep faster, getting better quality sleep and then being able to depend on it is something I wouldn't trade for anything. It's just, it took me some time to learn that. Plus there's an app that shows me all my info about my sleep every night and it lets me adjust the autopilot if I want. If your partner sleeps at a different side on the same bed, they can adjust the temperature in the app too, it's great. So I'll leave a link to it below, and since they're a great sponsor, they're actually giving you guys $200 off the pod cover if you use code ""MKBHD"" at eightsleep.com/mkbhd. But anyway, what's the verdict? What's the verdict with the new Pro iPhone of 2023? It's one of those things where like I have conversations with friends and I always end up having to try to condense it all and summarize it into like one sentence, and the truth is like, it's the same phone as last year with USB, a little bit of a faster chip, a little bit of a brighter screen, a little bit of thinner bezels, and like, I don't know, better cameras, that's kind of it. So you have to decide how much of that is important to you. Are any of those things important to you? Honestly, USB might be the most important thing about the new iPhone, despite what Apple was hoping. Welcome to the club, my friends. Thanks for watching, catch you guys in the next one, peace.

Marques Brownlee,piYf4gDthjY,Phone,Apple,"- All right, so this is an iPhone 15 and a 15 Plus and a 15 Pro and a 15 Pro Max, every new phone in the lineup. New colors, new materials, new ports. There's some good stuff to unbox here, so let's do it. So starting with iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. This iPhone 15 here is the new blue color, and it is, I'm just gonna go ahead and rename this color to barely blue. I think that's an appropriate name, because it really is barely giving hints of blue. You can really see it on the side rails too. But yeah, really subtle colors across the board this year. Anyway, the other things in the box are the paperwork, the single white Apple sticker, and there is no SIM card ejector tool here since they're all eSIM, at least in the US now. But most importantly, the new cable in the iPhone box for all new iPhones is a single, white, braided USB-C to USB-C cable. I think this is the first time the iPhone is shipping with a braided nice cable like this. So hopefully it'll be a higher quality and more durable than old cables we've been getting for years. So, cool, USB-C cable, USB-C phone. Now, if we take a look at the Plus, same idea, bigger box, but this new incredibly pale yellow. I mean, again, in perfect lighting at the Apple event I think it looked a little bit more colorful, but it just looks extremely pale out here. And then we've got the Pro boxes for the Pro phones as well. Still white boxes, but dark wallpapers. So the iPhone 15 Pro I have here is the new dark blue color. I almost want to call this one barely blue again, but this time it's darker and kind of borders on gray when the light hits it from certain angles. Very safe. Same stuff in the box after that though, the paperwork, the white Apple sticker, and the new braided USB-C cable. And then our iPhone 15 Pro Max here is the new Natural Titanium color. And I gotta say, guys, I think this is gonna be the one to get. It's the best color in person in the hand. I'll talk more about why in a minute, but there you have it. The slightly new unboxing experience on iPhone 15s and 15 Pros. So by the time you see this, I've been testing these phones for about six days now. Not quite enough time for a review by my standards, but still plenty of time to give you some interesting thoughts, some things that I've picked up on, and some quirks. So first of all, these pale colors. I don't really know how else to say it. Like, this might be totally fine with you. I always get told everyone's gonna put a case on their phone, which they probably are. But hey, Apple did spend a ton of time and money",0.45,621.843,144.41
Marques Brownlee,piYf4gDthjY,Phone,Apple,"making this new softer touch satin finish on the back, and some of us, some of us will carry our phones around with no case, so it's worth mentioning. For the Pro phones there's actually an extra layer of interesting though, because they've switched that rail material, the part that you actually touch on the outside, from shiny stainless steel to brushed titanium. We've all heard about how much lighter it is, and it's something like 10% lighter, which is enough for me to notice and enjoy. But the other thing is I thought the brushed finish would sort of eliminate fingerprints on the sides. Absolutely not. I was wrong about that. I mean, it's less, it's not as bad as stainless steel, but especially on these darker colors like the black or this blue, you can totally see fingerprints and sort of where your hand oils are marking up the sides of the phone. And then on top of that, this is not anodized like aluminum might be. This is the new PVD coating they talked about on stage. And it's only been a week here for me, and so I don't know exactly how well this will hold up over time, but what I do know is if you get a scratch deep enough into this coating, it's gotta be the Natural Titanium color underneath, which is very light. And so that might look rough, if you drop this phone with no case and get like a big gash on your dark colored phone and have light marks all over it. All of that to say, I do really think that this Natural Titanium or the light is gonna be the better color to get on the Pros this year. Okay, some things I've noticed in my first week. So first of all, on the Pro, the bezels are technically a little bit thinner, which makes the body a little smaller, but you really don't notice that much after a few minutes. What you do notice more actually visually is the slightly softer curves all the way around these phones, seriously, on the 15 and 15 Pro. Because on the 14 it was so square, like it just went straight to the edge with a flat display and then it dropped right into the rail at 90 degrees. On these new phones, the edge of the front glass actually has a little bit of curve at the very edges, so it's a softer curve into the rail. Then the rail itself has softer curves than the totally sharp corners from last year. So I think it's a nice hybrid of making it just more comfortable in the hand with these curves, but still keeping the generally boxy look. Now, with USB-C on these phones, we already learned that you can just plug in a cable to charge an accessory, right? So it's no reverse wireless charging,",145.11,621.843,131.7
Marques Brownlee,piYf4gDthjY,Phone,Apple,"but you can at least plug in a USB-C cable straight to AirPods or an Apple Watch MagSafe charger, whatever, and it will charge from your phone's battery. So that's already pretty interesting, but I decided it's worth learning all the rules and behaviors of plugging things into the iPhone 15s. So here they are. So if you plug in any older Lightning iPhone into a USB-C iPhone, regardless of the charge state, the USB-C iPhone will always give battery to the Lightning iPhone, every single time no matter what. Now, if you plug in another USB-C iPhone into your USB-C iPhone, it actually does a handshake where they talk to each other, figure out which one has the lower battery, and then the one with the higher state of charge goes, ""All right, I'm a battery bank, and I will start charging the one with the lower stated of charge,"" all the way till you unplug it. So I thought that was pretty interesting and it works pretty well. Then I decided to try a couple of Android phones and see if the same handshake happened. Basically what we found is if you plug into your friend's Android phone who has more battery than you and that phone has USB PD, it will actually act like a battery bank. But if the phone doesn't have USB PD, which is a bunch actually right now, it's pretty inconsistent and you could end up charging it or it could end up charging you. Literally unplug and try it again. But if it has USB Power Delivery, it will actually do the same handshake that the iPhones do. It's only 4 1/2 watts out, so it's not huge. It's not gonna fast charge or anything. But, you know, it is ideal for accessories. You can literally use the cable in the box to charge up the new AirPods or whatever else you wanna try. But yeah, you can rescue another smartphone in a pinch. So then the new Action button on the Pros. I was very curious about this. I was not sure if it would have some restrictions or if there's some things that it wouldn't let you do, and it turns out I haven't been able to find any so far. It seems like it basically lets you do anything you want, and I'm very happy about that. I mean, this was a feature of a lot of Android phones in the past. There were some LG phones that did this, some Sony phones, I wanna say some ASUS phones. I'm hoping it starts to make a bit of a comeback here, because on this new iPhone it is great. So you jump into the settings and go to Action button, and it loads up this whole crazy UI that's just nothing like any of the other settings pages",276.81,621.843,132.69
Marques Brownlee,piYf4gDthjY,Phone,Apple,"on the iPhone, like they just stapled this in here, but okay. And as I showed you in the impressions video, you can do any number of pre-programmed things with this button. By default, it is still the mute switch that it replaces, and it has those two different haptic patterns. So when you mute it in your pocket, you know exactly what you're doing without even checking you did it correctly. But honestly, I don't know. I leave my phone on mute most of the time anyway. So you can also have it open up the camera in any of the camera modes. But then again, the camera shortcut is, like, right on your lock screen already, and I'm pretty used to that. Same thing with the flashlight. You could do that, but it's also already on everyone's lock screen. I like the voice memo trigger. It's actually pretty convenient because it immediately starts recording when you press and hold the button. But my favorite by a mile is the Siri Shortcuts function because it basically lets you do anything else. You can stack up a bunch of different functions that are, like, location dependent, or you can have it call a certain contact or do certain things, or if you just wanna literally open any app on your phone with zero lag. So it could be your to-do list app or your calendar app or just open YouTube with any one button press. Whatever you want. For me, I'm gonna map my Action button on my brand new iPhone to the Google Assistant, the best assistant available on the iPhone. Also, Apple, if you're listening, I also wish you could map a double press or a triple press of the Action button to a new specific function. Just think about it. Also, I was kind of curious how cases would handle this new Action button. So I asked channel sponsor dbrand to send over their new Ghost case, and I have it here. Personally, pretty solid. I think this matte black skeleton design looks sick. And yes, I can confirm that even with the case, the Action button still feels nice and clicky. Now, I might be thinking, all right, what's so special about this clear case? I've seen a million clear cases. And between the skeleton and MagSafe, there's a bunch of other stuff, but my favorite personally is if you've ever owned a clear case before, you probably know that after a while it kind of ends up looking like this, which is disgusting and yellow. But dbrand has promised me that they've specifically engineered the Ghost case to be impossible to yellow, and they use those words themselves.",409.5,621.843,125.10600000000001
Marques Brownlee,piYf4gDthjY,Phone,Apple,"So they actually give you a lifetime case replacement guarantee if it every yellows. So that's either a real promise or free cases for life, the way I see it. Either way, if you're interested, I'll leave a link below the like button if you wanna check it out. That's the dbrand Ghost case. Now, I've also been taking some pictures and videos with these new cameras to get a sense of how they perform. I will be taking many, many more, posting them on on Twitter if you wanna follow me there. Instagram as well. I also fully plan on shooting the next Auto Focus car channel video with this phone, so you already know you can go subscribe over there to see how the video looks, to hear how the microphones sound. One thing that they did mention in the keynote specifically was there was a new coating over the lenses that I immediately thought, oh, does this fix the horrible nighttime flare issues with the iPhone's video? First thing I did was go to a dark room, bring it out at night, shoot with some lights. No, it didn't fix it, unfortunately. I'm sure the coating does some other great stuff during the daytime, but there's still flare issues, sadly. But also, lastly, I wanna clarify the new camera behavior on the Pro phones. In the impressions video, I was a little down on the whole, like, 1x versus 1.2x versus 1.5x thing, because I thought it was literally just a digital crop, which would be pretty pointless to me. But it's actually closer to a set of Super Res Zoom presets that you can actually then digitally zoom between. I'll detail all of this in the full reviews. And here's some benchmark scores in case you're curious about that sort of thing for performance for the A17 Pro, which is actually new. But generally, I think that wraps up my first, second impressions, my second look now that I got 'em in the studio. Really I feel like the base iPhone 15s, if you wanna buy one of these or pre-order 'em, it's a bigger improvement than it seems on paper. Like, nothing is actually new here, but because it's bringing things from last year's Pro phone, it's actually a very solid phone. And then the Pro, it's a lot more interesting because there's some genuinely new stuff happening. I've seen new stuff with the cameras. Also, it seems like someone found out the batteries are slightly bigger across the board, which is good too. We'll see if that holds up. But generally, let me know what you wanna see in the full reviews in the comment section below, because I will be working on those over the next couple days and weeks, and hopefully you'll see that soon. Either way, thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace. (mellow electronic music)",536.55,621.843,141.886
Marques Brownlee,305YfKMyqVw,Phone,Apple,"- All right, so Apple's Wonderlust event happened. It was pretty interesting. Honestly, not that much stuff actually got announced. I mean, we knew it was gonna be iPhone, Apple Watch, USB-C, not that much other stuff. But it was more the stuff in between the lines that was kind of interesting and some other random stuff that I don't think a lot of people are talking about. So let's talk about it. Now, first of all, I gotta say, it was a complete surprise to me when one of the first things that they did was quote my MacBook Air review. So you know, like, the beginning of the keynotes they usually do where they sort of recap a bunch of stuff that's previously happened? One of the things they did was talk about the MacBook Air, and this happened. - And Marques Brownlee said, ""The 15-inch MacBook Air is going to instantly rocket to the top of the lineup to become the most popular 15-inch laptop."" We love the new MacBook Air and the entire Mac lineup. - And that was pretty cool. I gotta say, they didn't tell me they were gonna do that. They didn't ask. They didn't pay for it. They just kind of did it. So shout-out to Tim. I guess in this case, it's totally fine. I guess there's just an element of pride knowing that, like, it's come a long way since the beginning. I remember like 6, 7, 8 years ago when there was zero YouTubers at any of these events, and then there was one and then there were three or four and then there were 12 or 13 and just now we're all just a part of the media, independent creators doing our thing. So I feel like it's kind of a cool moment to see that come full circle. But anyway, after that, they just got right into the announcements, the flagship of which being the new iPhone. So I made an entire separate video on the iPhones, my first hands-on and impressions of all the little details and my first thoughts of everything. So I'll link that below the Like button if you wanna check it out if you're interested. But I'll just do a brief summary here for you. So the iPhone 15 gets the A16 Bionic chip from last year's iPhone Pro. It gets the Dynamic Island, of course, from the Pro as well. Some new colors and a slightly updated design with little better curve radiuses, radii, a slightly nicer feel in the hand, and a satin soft-touch back and a slow USB-C port. Same starting price and screen sizes as last year,",0.33,621.843,122.82300000000002
Marques Brownlee,305YfKMyqVw,Phone,Apple,"799 for the iPhone 15 and 899 for the iPhone 15 Plus. So then the iPhone 15 Pro gets a new three-nanometer A17 Pro chip. There's these new brushed lighter titanium rails to replace the stainless steel, a faster USB-C port, a customizable action button on the side to replace the mute switch, a new set of cameras, and just the 15 Pro Max gets a new 5x telephoto camera. And the prices are kind of sneaky. So it's still 999 for the 15 Pro but the Pro Max now starts at 1,199 because it's also starting at 256 gigs. There's a lot more details and interesting stuff about the iPhone in that hands-on video, so you know where to find that. But then there's the other stuff of this event. Also, I thought it would be cool to shoot here since this is part of where they shot some scenes in the keynote, but now I'm realizing that it's a real place. There's like chainsaws in the background. So sorry about the noise. Anyway, we've got Apple Watch stuff, right? So Series 9 and Ultra 2. And one of the most interesting things about these new watches is that visually, just looking at them, there's almost no way to actually tell that you're looking at the new watch. It's very unlike Apple. So I think there's a new pink color with the Series 9, but other than that, it looks identical to the Series 8 and the Ultra 2 looks identical to the Ultra. But instead, under the hood, there's a big process update to this new S9 system on a chip, which is more powerful and more efficient, and that's allowing them to push the watches to a higher max brightness while keeping the same quoted battery life. So the Series 9 is gonna get up to 2,000 nits max brightness now and the Ultra 2 is up to 3,000 nits, which is actually now, it's the brightest display ever on any Apple product. And they've also moved all Siri requests on the watch now to stay on device instead of always having to do a round trip to the internet, which I think could help, 'cause there's a lot of instances of Siri where you, like, ask it, ""What's the time in Cupertino?"" And it goes, ""Hold on a second. Wait for it. I'm thinking about it. I don't know yet,"" and it's just frustrating and it doesn't work.",124.62,621.843,120.6
Marques Brownlee,305YfKMyqVw,Phone,Apple,"So that should be faster and more efficient. It doesn't mean Siri's gonna be good. It just means it'll be bad but faster. But then there's also a new Ultra Wideband chip that can talk to the iPhones to make Find My iPhone way more precise and actually point out a direction to help you find your phone instead of just playing a sound. I think that's gonna be super useful for a lot of people. But the most sneaky, interesting update here to the watch is this new double tap gesture. So, so, okay, you've got the new watch on and, basically, it's always able to detect if you do this double tap of your thumb and your index finger together. And so I got to try it a bunch of times at the event with a demo watch in the hands-on area. It actually seemed very accurate. Like, you basically, you raise it to wake, give it a split second, and then double tap to press the primary button of whatever app you're in that's on your screen at the moment. So it can accept or reject an incoming phone call or stop a timer or scroll through the Smart Stack of widgets on the watch face. And yeah, it was working really well for me very quickly. This would clearly be super helpful if my other hand is busy or I'm holding something or I just wanna quickly do something. Ordinarily, honestly, I would be trying to do that with my nose. So this is much better. Now, the reason I say this is sneaky is because I don't know if you remember, just a few weeks ago or months ago, this is the same gesture used to select things while you're wearing Apple Vision Pro. In the VR headset, selecting things is like this. And so now on the watch, selecting things is like that. Now, some of you have already pointed out on Twitter this isn't exactly new completely. If you've ever dug through the accessibility settings on the Apple Watch before, you've probably found by a slightly different name basically the exact same feature and you've been able to double tap and do all kinds of other things. Now, why isn't this new double tap to select primary stuff feature coming to other Apple watches, you might be asking. Apple says that basically this new S9 chip is much faster at processing all the info from all those sensors and so you'll be able to do it more readily. And so that's why it's only coming",245.22,621.843,126.89999999999998
Marques Brownlee,305YfKMyqVw,Phone,Apple,"to the new S9-powered Apple watches. It's convenient. But let's talk about AirPods real quick because this might actually be the ultimate sneaky update. So the fact is these barely even got mentioned during the keynote, right? Like, they just casually dropped that there would be a new USB-C case for the AirPods Pro 2 in, like, one fleeting slide and that was basically it. So you could be led to believe that there's just nothing new with the AirPods themselves and they're exactly the same. But you'd be wrong. So basically, for all intents and purposes, AirPods Pro 2 with the wireless charging Lightning case and AirPods Pro 2 with the wireless charging USB-C case are the same product with a different port unless you have Apple Vision Pro, in which case, the USB-C version will be capable of doing lossless audio with low latency with this new codec that Apple has created just for this purpose, this awesome immersive experience. So if you don't have Apple Vision Pro, then they're basically the same product with two different ports, but there is actually new hardware and new architecture to make this feature possible with the new USB-C version. I don't think they wanna talk about that too much to not make people who just bought them last week feel too bad about it, but they're actually different headphones. So that's a sneaky update right there from Apple behind the scenes on one of their most popular products. But that's a good transition just to get to the last seemingly big pillar of this announcement, which was carbon neutrality and the environment. So Apple couldn't stop talking about the environment throughout this keynote, including one huge overly self-congratulatory, like, 10-minute skit in the middle of the keynote video with Tim Cook and Apple employees talking to Mother Nature about how much progress they've made with their products environmentally. I just basically want to dig more into this later. I would say I'm not an expert on this, so there's no way that I can fully appreciate now and fully understand now everything that was said. There's a lot of specific language used. Some of it is very clear, like just straight up not using any leather anymore in any Apple products, using recycled materials instead of new virgin materials, things like that,",372.12,621.843,125.45599999999996
Marques Brownlee,305YfKMyqVw,Phone,Apple,"having more sustainable energy sources. But then there's other things that they, I mean, there was a lot. There was a lot going on and some of it is not quite as simple. But they have clearly made a lot of progress and change and they eventually landed on this moment where they were like, ""The Apple Watch is the first fully carbon neutral product that Apple's actually shipping,"" on their way to ideally being fully carbon neutral as a company by 2030. And so there's a lot of progress that they still need to make. And as much as we've talked about how much Apple still needs to do, I kind of feel like I can't get mad at this. Like, you know what it feels like, you ever see those like YouTube videos where a YouTuber on the street, they'll be micd up and they'll, like, give a homeless person a hundred bucks or something and half the comments are like, ""Oh, come on, you clearly didn't have to do it on camera. Like, if you really cared, then you would do it not on camera."" And that's probably all mostly true, but also, that person in need still did just get a hundred bucks. So it's like some net positive was still done. And this kind of feels the same way to me. Like, okay, Apple is actually doing a bunch of stuff to use recycled materials and to make less of an impact on the environment and then they're doing a big song and dance about it so everyone can see it, so that everyone sees it. And so you'd say, ""Okay, if they really cared, they would do a whole bunch more stuff."" And that's still true, but I can't get mad at the improvements that they are actually making. Hopefully that makes sense. Either way, like I said, I'm not an expert. I wanna dig more into this. I wanna talk to some people who actually are experts on it who can help me out and maybe that's a future topic for another video. But that's just my thoughts and reactions from the Wonderlust event of 2023. Let me know what your thoughts are below. There's a lot to talk about and a lot of random, sneaky stuff and the comments section is always open to talk about it. And techtember rolls on. So stick with us. Subscribe if you haven't already. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys later. Peace. (upbeat music)",498.443,621.843,116.42999999999999
Marques Brownlee,enR58PYHaWw,Phone,Apple,"- All right, so today I got a hold of and got to poke around the new iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Pros. I do remember flying here and I'm thinking what could Apple possibly do? Like what could they possibly introduce with a new iPhone, the 23rd iPhone that's actually interesting? Now, there is more stuff than just the iPhone that was mentioned at this Wonderlust event that Apple hosted including some stuff that straight up wasn't mentioned on stage at all, so we'll get to that. But this is just the new iPhone stuff. So stay tuned and get subscribed to see the rest. But let's just talk about the new iPhone 15 and 15 Pro. So here's a lens to look at all this stuff through. Coming into this, basically everything Apple just added to their newest flagship phones falls into two buckets. It's either something we've already seen in some other phone for years, or it's some ecosystem feature that only works with other iPhones, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it's just a lens to look through this stuff at, just to keep an eye on it. So this is the iPhone 15. There's the same two sizes, again, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. And yeah, you know there's some small changes, like the slight soft corner radii on the aluminum rails and the one piece glass back fading between a lighter and darker version of the same color, like this new pink one. It's pretty seamless. Also, satin soft touch backs across the whole lineup instead of glossy. I definitely like that. But the big headlining feature really is its USB now. Lightning is officially dead. These new iPhones are all USB-C across the board. Now on one hand, this is a huge deal, like there's only ever been one port change in the iPhone ever. Back in 2012, it went from that 30-pin connector thing to this new lightning thing, which we've had ever since. And now the second one ever is USB type C. But on the other hand it's, I don't know, it's just USB. Like it's the same port all these other laptops and tablets all over the planet have had for the past couple years. I imagine that might be another year or two before the whole lineup, like the baseline cheap iPad and the iPhone SE and everything else gets USB-C. But yeah, I don't know. We knew it was coming, but it's still kind of surreal to look at an iPhone and see a USB port on it. So what does this enable is a real question, right? First of all, it's the one cable that you can ideally use to charge all your stuff, so your Mac, your iPad, your iPhone, your friend's Android phone, the new AirPods which just got a new USB-C case. All that stuff, one cable. Oh, and now you can charge accessories like the new AirPods with the wire. So there's no wireless reverse charging right now, but that C to C cable that comes in the box, you can like plug it into the iPhone, plug it into the AirPods and charge the AirPods up from the iPhone battery. So that's pretty cool. But they did hold back on one very key thing and they saved it for the iPhone 15 Pro.",0.18,621.843,162.05999999999997
Marques Brownlee,enR58PYHaWw,Phone,Apple,"So I'll get to that in a bit, but that's the USB-C. Aside from that, really it's a slightly updated phone. It's a little bit of a new display. You know, you get the Dynamic Island here, of course, on these baseline iPhones and there's also now a higher peak brightness, 2,000 nits now which is twice as bright as the iPhone 14s. And there's a new camera. The primary camera is now a 48-megapixel chip, presumably the same one that was in the iPhone 14 Pro last year and all the benefits that come with that. And then the rest of the phone really follows that same formula. They do this thing where the new baseline phone is basically last year's Pro phone repackaged, so it inherits the same A16 Bionic chip from last year's Pro phone. The coolest feature of this phone though, and you know, it's also on the Pro phone but I still think it's pretty solid, is the camera has this new next-generation portrait mode but basically it automatically detects when there's a subject in a photo and captures all of the depth information needed to be able to turn it into a portrait mode photo later. So you don't have to remember to switch it to portrait mode necessarily every time. And if you ever forget but want to add that blur later, you can do it with high quality results. So that's cool. Aside from that, the rest of the phone, I mean it's the same thing, right? Same sizes, guys, same ceramic shield, same dust and water resistance and same starting prices, 799 for the 15 and 899 for the 15 Plus. So then there is the Pro phones, the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. There is some more new here. A lot of it, I'm actually gonna want to test just to see if it's actually what they say, but make sure you get subscribed to see those full reviews when they come out later this month and we can figure out if the phones are worth it. But basically it's not bleeding edge stuff that we've never seen before. It's just welcome stuff. And those are mostly in build quality, the chip inside, and the cameras. So let's just start with the chip inside. First of all, it's a brand new chip that's called the A17 Pro. It's the first time they've used the word Pro in an iPhone chip, and it's their first three nanometer chip, so it promises some performance and efficiency improvements as a result. I think they said it's like 10% faster high performance cores and the neural engines up to twice as fast, bunch of other stuff. Not sure how much of this you'll actually notice in everyday use, but hey, future proofing and headroom is never a bad thing, so this is clearly a powerful chip. They showed a demo of a game with like faster ray tracing which isn't new, but you know, it helped make their point. But the interesting thing to note here with this chip is they mentioned the chip has a new USB 3 controller on it, which means the 15 and 15 Plus don't have that. So basically that means the Pro iPhones USB-C port",162.24,621.843,153.85999999999999
Marques Brownlee,enR58PYHaWw,Phone,Apple,"actually gets upgraded USB 3 speeds, the faster data transfer speeds up to 10 gigabits per second, but the base iPhones without that controller, they get USB-C, but they're gonna be stuck at USB 2.0 speeds. Basically the same we've always had with lightning, like 480 megabits per second. Now this probably won't make a real difference to most people. Like I don't know when the last time you plugged your phone in was, but it's kind of a bummer that not all of the benefits of USB-C come to all of the phones, but for the Pro phones that are gonna be shooting more ProRes video or ProRaw photos, I mean it takes forever. If you've shot this stuff like I have, you know it takes forever to get those off of the phone 'cause they're big files. So I kind of wish they'd gone all the way. I wish they'd done Thunderbolt speeds, 20, 30, 40 gigabits per second. But yeah, it's just gonna be USB 3 on the Pro iPhones and USB 2 on the base iPhones. You know what is disappointing, though? No fast charging. I talked about this on the podcast on ""Waveform."" I'll try to link the episode below, but like switching to USB-C, you'd think, oh, this is a huge opportunity for Apple to like explain why they're doing it, and we know why they're doing it, but oh, why are you giving us this new port and all this big new USB-C deal and it's just the same 20 or so watt charging we've had for the iPhone for forever, no new fast charging. Kind of figured they would try to do that better. But yeah, this will still take an hour and a half, two hours to charge. But anyway, the new design is what most people are fawning over at the moment with the pros. So they have switched the rails from that shiny fingerprint stainless steel to this new grade 5 titanium alloy with a brushed texture. And it's nice. First of all, it's noticeably lighter in the hand, which I love and it seems like it's also enabled them to shrink the body of the Pro iPhones just a little bit. So they have the same screen sizes, but the screens now get even closer to the edges and there's even slightly thinner bezels. And I actually do notice that. Now, a lot of people are also quoting stronger as one of the benefits too, but I really don't think this is gonna make as much of a difference as people are thinking. Like the Pro iPhones have had this stainless steel rails for a while now. I've dropped this phone, as you know, I don't have a case, on the ground. I've dented the stainless steel rails. It's fine, it doesn't break. It's not the stainless steel that breaks, it's the glass that breaks. And as far as we can tell, it's the same ceramic shield glass on the iPhone 15 Pro. That hasn't changed. So if you drop it on the glass, you're still gonna have not great results. But yeah, technically, sure, titanium is stronger.",317.25,621.843,156.03300000000002
Marques Brownlee,enR58PYHaWw,Phone,Apple,"Either way, the new colors are black, white and this new blue which is really subtle, and then natural which I guess, it kind of embraces the raw titanium feel. Reminds me of ""Starlight,"" if you're curious. Kinda like this warm tone. Weirdly, I think I like it the most. But also something else Apple set on stage, and this was pretty quick so you might not have even picked it up, but they did mention that they have redesigned a bit of the interior of the chassis to make the back glass more replaceable. So it's a more repairable iPhone design. Technically. It's a small thing, it's just one little step, but it's a step in the right direction for a more repairable iPhone. But my favorite feature, and before we get to any of the cameras, I honestly think this is my favorite feature, is the new action button, a new customizable button on the side of the iPhone, just the Pro iPhone. So it replaces the mute switch, which is pretty iconic, but it's in the same spot as the mute switch and it's actually customizable. So it's a pretty small button, basically about the same size as the switch. And by default, it actually behaves just like the mute switch did. So you actually hold it down to switch between muted or ringer on, great. But if you dive into the settings, there's actually a section for this action button and it's actually really in depth and super solid. It basically lets you go through and pick the function of the button, and there's way more here than I expected. So you can keep the mute switch on, or you can have it switch you in and out of a certain focus mode, like do not disturb, or you could pick whichever other one you want. You could also have it auto launch the camera and pick whichever camera mode it opens. You could also do flashlight turning on or opening up voice memos, or it can toggle the magnifier. Or the last option actually is you can have it trigger a series shortcut, which as you know, can technically do almost anything, including basically launching any app on your phone. I think there may be a bit of a delay from the button press to the app opening, if I'm thinking about this correctly, like it's done in the past but I'll have to test that for the full review. But theoretically, you can map this button to open whatever, your calendar app, your to-do list app, whatever app you want which is totally not what I expected to be on the list of things you could do with a new button on the side of the iPhone. But now you can. But then last but not least, the new cameras across the board here. There's a new larger 48-megapixel main sensor for the Pros and improved ultra wide. And then the Pro Max, just the Pro Max gets a new intricate folding 5X telephoto camera. I'm guessing if I asked Apple, they would say that there is only enough room in the bigger Pro Max to fit this folding lens. I'll ask, we'll see what they say. But until then, the regular 15 Pro",474.18,621.843,155.15
Marques Brownlee,enR58PYHaWw,Phone,Apple,"is gonna still have the 3X telephoto, the regular 3X from last year. And then we found this seemingly random feature, it's in the settings, they also talked about it in the keynote, but where you can change your default focal length to be either 1X or 1.2X or 1.5X, for some reason. So it's buried in the middle of the camera settings, but you can tell it to default to one of these specific three focal lengths. So if you switch back to the camera app, that 1X button is now always going to take you to the new focal length that you've chosen. And you can still get to 1X or whatever other focal length you want, but I just found that interesting. If you're someone that takes 1.2X photos so often that you want a button to get there as fast as possible 'cause it's the perfect focal length for you, then sure. Maybe if you're a photographer, you don't wanna do the work of digital cropping, just hit that focal length every time, sure. But there's been a lot of comments that at the end of the day, it feels like USB is literally the biggest headlining new feature of this year's new iPhone, which is crazy. I can't quite get rid of my lightning cable yet. There's still some accessories, there's like MagSafe Duo there's AirPods Max, there's like the Magic Trackpad, there's a couple things that still are lightning now, maybe they'll switch that in the next couple months. But now I'm genuinely curious if there's going to be a bunch of new USB-C phone accessories because of of the iPhone getting USB-C, similar to our sponsor of this video, Anker. So they've made a whole new lineup of products for the iPhone 15 headlined by the Anker Nano which is like this little small but mighty USB-C power bank that can crank out 30 watts with the built-in USB-C cable and it can also charge it up 30 watts. And if you have that little button up at the top here, it'll actually show a literal percentage of how much battery you have left, or if you're plugged in, it'll show you a time which counts down so you really know exactly how much of the 10,000 milliamp-hours you have left. Plus there's some other stuff in the lineup. There's a wall charger, braided USB-C cables galore. So feel free to learn more about Anker's new lineup at the link below and shout out to Anker for sponsoring this video. So iPhone 15 Pro will start at the same price as last year, which is 999, but they've bumped up iPhone 15 Pro Max sneakily. Interestingly, it will start at 1,199 but it's also the only one with the 5X camera and it's the only one that starts at 256 gigs. And last year, the price of the 256 gig Pro was the same, so you're kind of matching. It's just like getting rid of the $1,100 phone, for some reason. Either way, let me know if you're interested in these new iPhones at all. You're either in camp don't care at all, or you're in camp like totally getting one of these. Or maybe you're watching to see if the reviews prove that the new features are worth it. Let me know what you're thinking. Comment section's always open.

Marques Brownlee,ltpbEQA8Fwc,Phone,Apple,iPhones also now get a lighter stronger titanium Rail and faster three nanometer chip and there's some camera improvements that we'll have to test like every year and the pro Max also gets the new 5x telephoto camera coolest thing though in my opinion the mute,27.119,621.843,22.259999999999998
Marques Brownlee,ltpbEQA8Fwc,Phone,Apple,switch is gone from the pros and there's a customizable action button instead and it can do a bunch of stuff more than I expected including muting your phone and then we also got some new Apple watches it's a series 9 and the ultra two they both look exactly the same as last year,38.219,621.843,24.0
Marques Brownlee,ltpbEQA8Fwc,Phone,Apple,but there is a much improved faster chip under the hood and they are allegedly Apple's first completely carbon neutral product there are way more details though so get subscribed to make sure you see the full video and the Hands-On with the new iPhones,50.219,621.843,20.861000000000004
Marques Brownlee,a01edYZIfjc,Phone,Apple,all right so this is the new yellow iPhone 14 plus so Apple's been doing these mid-cycle new colors just to keep the iPhone fresh and talked about there haven't been that many yellow phones over the years this one is a,0.02,621.843,22.738999999999997
Marques Brownlee,a01edYZIfjc,Phone,Apple,surprisingly polarizing yellow like some people in the studio love it some people hate it only one thing feels super useful to do here compared to other yellow things so basically this one is a really safe light pale yellow it's,12.019,621.843,23.46
Marques Brownlee,a01edYZIfjc,Phone,Apple,lighter than almost anything I've compared it to it's lighter than the iPhone 10r from a few years ago it's lighter than a New York City metro card which kind of feels orange next to this it makes a banana feel like a much,23.9,621.843,20.701
Marques Brownlee,a01edYZIfjc,Phone,Apple,darker yellow in comparison oh you know Snapchat yellow they made that pixie drone it's even lighter than that the one part of this phone that looks dark is the sides this is a slightly closer to a gold color on the side rails,34.04,621.843,23.52
Marques Brownlee,a01edYZIfjc,Phone,Apple,basically the closest two things I found to match this phone are this Big Bird plush which came straight from Sesame Street so it must be accurate and Mac seems to vastly prefer it over the iPhone's yellow and that old yellow subscribe button from the YouTube's past but you should totally hit that new subscribe button,45.98,621.843,29.678
Marques Brownlee,35BkHichD2M,Phone,Apple,you would think that the most expensive best iPhone is the one with the best battery life right nope this here is the new iPhone 14 plus it's basically just the iPhone 14 but bigger so the mini sized iPhone is dead after two years and they've replaced it with this plus size version which means a bigger screen and a bigger battery I will say it is a bit lighter than you'd probably expect that aluminum makes this big phone actually lighter than the smaller Pro with its stainless steel but there's really not that much else interesting here except that when Apple announced it on stage they said that it would be the best battery life ever in an iPhone and then they just moved on I guess that does make sense though right it's the same size as the iPhone 14 pro Max same battery size roughly but with a dimmer 60 hertz display so I guess yeah it should last longer but is it actually substantially longer see when you get to Apple's website the iPhone 14 pro Max is the one listed at 29 hours of video playback Which is higher than this 14 plus which is listed at 26 hours but then again just for audio playback the plus will do a hundred hours for the first time which is more than the pro Max which is just 95 hours super useful for those of us doing five straight hours of audio playback in airplane mode right but no that this is the first point I wanted to make in this video which is that in the smartphone World these days the benchmarks are less and less relevant than ever and I almost don't even pay attention to them anymore unlike back in the day when they used to be really important like years ago new phones would come out and they would have huge year-over-year performance gains which was exciting but mostly because they would actually like unlock new things that you could do with your phone things like shooting 4K video for the first time or playing HD games or,2.179,621.843,216.70000000000005
Marques Brownlee,35BkHichD2M,Phone,Apple,taking HDR photos with a bunch of different exposures so that big jump in raw performance year over year meant before the jump you couldn't do a thing and then after the jump you crushed a threshold and now you could which was sweet but smartphones are so evolved and so complete nowadays that basically every smartphone can do all the fundamental things very well it's more around the edges that they're starting to optimize for certain tasks certain things so yes the overall power and the geekbench score still does go up a little bit year over year every year but that doesn't really mean nearly as much as it used to it doesn't really mean anything significant other than maybe a few more frames per second in a game or launching an app slightly faster Plus in this one's case it's the same chip as last year so it means almost nothing but what's really happening now is companies are developing their own silicon with special sections of their system on a chip designed to accelerate certain functions that they think will be a priority for their users so if Apple you know the a series chips and the iPhones means big performance cores small efficiency cores but then a bunch of other stuff things like a prores accelerator for faster video encoding there is a neural engine for optimizing machine learning tasks and there's a special image signal processor for fusing to together different exposures into a photo very quickly and a display engine that helps smoothly run those animations for the Pro phone on the dynamic island with Google you've got the new tensor chip in their pixel phones again big cores small cores but then dedicated pieces for machine learning for their Crazy Fast speech to text there's an image signal processor for HDR plus and then more and more some apple flagships even though they haven't gotten to designing their own silicon,110.759,621.843,206.221
Marques Brownlee,35BkHichD2M,Phone,Apple,entirely are still adding things like a specialized ISP to the find X5 Pro for processing photos the way they want to much faster and now it's even starting to apply to all types of other devices we already know about Apple silicon Max you know the M1 chip having a prores accelerator because that's important to a lot of people using Pro Max also the steam deck has a custom Apu that lets it hit certain frame rates in lower power States basically the point is these companies are now adding focused pieces of compute Hardware when they design products based on what they think is a priority to their users and accelerate those those things dramatically and those pieces make a bigger difference than any Benchmark will show like here here's this is a good analogy I like a good comparison so let's say you need a vehicle for the fastest time around a track and you get to choose between vehicle a and vehicle B all you get to choose from is benchmarks so the benchmarks for vehicle a is it did a 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds it got on a Dyno and measured 502 horsepower and 339 pound-feet of torque then vehicle B did the 0 to 60 in three seconds flat it measured 835 horsepower and 908 pound-feet of torque so okay just based on those numbers a sensible person would probably lean towards picking vehicle B that would mean you just picked the rivion r1t a very fast pickup truck but you just picked that over the 2018 Porsche 911 GT3 one of the best track cars ever made that's how I feel about relying on basic General benchmarks these days like the benchmarks tell one story about the general overall capability but you still should be picking based on the specific features and things you want to do like you want to carry around lots of huge things get the one with the huge trunk do you want to make quick turns at high speeds get the one with the arrow pieces do you,213.72,621.843,228.11899999999997
Marques Brownlee,35BkHichD2M,Phone,Apple,want to take lots of pictures and videos of yourself and your friends get the one with the best cameras do you want the one with the longest possible battery life get the big one but speaking of battery life I do actually want to mention that I have noticed I've gotten better battery life on the iPhone 14 Pros after disabling the always on display this is something we were wondering from the review I've had a couple days or weeks now to do it and yeah it does make a difference but that actually leads to the second part of the video when I wanted to go over a little bit more which is the state of the iPhone 14s about a month later so it's been an interesting couple of weeks testing these phones and seeing what's happening to other people with their phones my reviews went out using the phone's Apple loans for reviews but then since then I've gotten my own that I've bought and started using full-time I haven't really had any major issues but it does seem like this has been one of the notably buggier launches of a new iOS and iPhone in the past couple years and even though it's not happening to my phones it's hard to ignore so there was a pretty famous camera jittering bug with the pro iPhones but for a quick iOS 16.0.2 update I ironed that out the only issue I've personally noticed on mine is my iPhone 14 pro often takes forever to connect to wireless car play and often just fails and doesn't connect but then again I can't tell if that's just the new iOS or the Cadillac lyric that's causing this exact problem but I asked on Twitter hey how is everyone's iPhone 14 experience is going so far the first few weeks and of course this is going to be a pretty focused sample but thousands and thousands of you chimed in and I've spent quite a while reading through a lot of this stuff and it's almost a little bit surprising how many bugs I've been getting tweeted about here are the,328.02,621.843,205.021
Marques Brownlee,35BkHichD2M,Phone,Apple,three most frequent things that I'm seeing from you guys in my Twitter Dimension so the first one is lock screen stuff specifically uh it seems like there's like an auto rotate bug when customizing your lock screen tons of people send me screenshots of it videos of it it hasn't happened to mine but it's been annoying because then you kind of have to reset your phone restart it and start it again but that's like the number one thing I saw most frequently then number two was Dynamic Island stuff so a lot of people with the pro phones have noticed weird bugs with Dynamic Island the software bubble like moving to the wrong place or animating weirdly getting stuck in animations quirky stuff like that I kind of expected that to happen a little bit at the beginning but that obviously kind of breaks the illusion of it just being this little seamless little pill box of software that's annoying but then number three is battery drain and this is the one I am most concerned about a sort of alarming number of people just when I asked about it it's been floating around there already but people just chiming in with like yep the battery doesn't last as long as I expected it doesn't last as long as a previous phone I had it's been draining and telling me that it's been draining and I'll like wake up in the middle of the night and have like a warm phone with a nearly dead battery weird stuff uh so that's the one that I'm gonna keep my eye on that I think Apple's probably also going to be paying the most attention to it's the hardest one to fix also shout out to channel sponsor dbrand they just dropped this new sick digital camo design they call it glitch camo they've also got a navy and Arctic colorway available great way to make your iPhone stand out from the rest you can check these out at the link below but there you have it that's the iPhone 14 plus and the iPhones one month later thanks for watching you guys in the next one peace [Music],430.68,621.843,210.66
Marques Brownlee,v94jRN2FhGo,Phone,Apple,[Music] hey what's up mkhd here okay i've already reviewed the iphone 14 pro and 14 pro max you can watch those at the link below the like button the dynamic island the camera upgrade all that the bottom line is that is a far more interesting set of phones that has a few things that are actually new to the iphone which is kind of cool the iphone 14 on the other hand uh not so much not so much this is almost the exact same phone as last year so do you remember those s updates we used to get like we'd have the iphone 5 and then the iphone 5s and then s for speed because it was the same phone but just faster this phone is even less of an update than those s upgrades used to be and so that's what i want to talk about in this review is this new repackaging strategy thing that apple's been doing especially more lately with a bunch of their products so this year we do get an iphone 14 and an iphone 14 plus this 14 is out now and the 14 plus is coming out in a month in october it's basically the same thing just bigger 6.1 inches here 6.7 inches there and so many things are the same as last year's phone on the outside the design is the same the iphone 13 cases literally work with the iphone 14. like this is the new ali abdowl dbrand grip case on the iphone 14 it's pretty sweet but then again here is my iphone 13 from last year and yep fits perfectly but yeah same squared off sides same button placement same camera arrangement same antennas same speakers etc and then on the inside it's literally the same chip from last year it's the a15 bionic again technically a slight bump up with the extra gpu cores that was in the 13 pro but i mean yeah last year's chip too now technically you could say these are all things that i liked about the iphone 13 so hey if it ain't broke don't fix it right that's apple but that also means that a lot of things that could have stood to improve that could have gotten better also didn't change so it's the same display with the same brightness and the same 60hz refresh rate in an 800 phone i mean it would be so unlike apple but i really would have loved to have seen like 90 hertz here but yeah same storage options same battery size same charging speeds same lightning port the way i see it it's an iphone 13 again a year later with some tiny improvements matter of fact here is a full comprehensive list of every single thing that's technically new okay crash detection satellite connectivity display resolution e-sim new colors better thermal design better repairability design new primary camera and new selfie camera well this should be easy so crash detection is cool it uses some new sensors inside the phone and combines a,0.68,621.843,348.36099999999993
Marques Brownlee,v94jRN2FhGo,Phone,Apple,bunch of data from the gps and microphones etc to notice if you've been in a car crash and if you have it'll notify emergency services without you having to do anything it's cool it's a nice feature i hope i never have to use it and then if you're in the middle of nowhere with no cell service and you still need help the iphone 14 series can now communicate with satellites in case of emergency to help you get your location and your needs to someone at a dispatch center that's coming to the us and canada in november that's another nice feature that i hope i never have to use the display is technically a slightly higher resolution with slightly thinner bezels but you will definitely never notice that and the new lineup in the us is now also e-sim only to be fair the setup process and transferring service from my previous iphone's physical sim was actually super easy it's like maybe two minutes tops and most other phones coming out today new also support esim so i'm hoping the transfer process in the future is also smooth but yeah no physical sim card tray here in the states there also is this new blue color then again most of you like an extremely high percentage of you have said that you use a case on your phone so i wonder how many of those are clear cases and then apple did mention an improved thermal design inside this phone for the same a15 bionic chip which can help performance at the edges of normal use cases so like playing a game for a really long time or navigating with high screen brightness with the phone in your dashboard in your car on a hot sunny day things that might get extra warm have an added layer of protection against throttling i think that's something the pro users will care more about but i definitely won't complain that it's also here and the better repairability design was mentioned also near the end of the keynote it's a little thing but it's actually pretty surprising from apple which is that the glass back is now a separate piece from the rest of the internals making it easier to replace cool but easily the biggest physical change with these new iphones is going to be the cameras so there's a slightly new 12 megapixel primary camera the ultrawide is exactly the same hardware and a new 12 megapixel selfie camera with autofocus now i spent a bunch of time looking back and forth at pictures i took on the iphone 14 and the iphone 13 trying to pinpoint the improvements it's like a game of spot the differences and there are some differences but they are so slight so this new camera is still 12 megapixels but it is a larger sensor so the individual pixels are bigger and should let in more light and then the max aperture went from f 1.6 to f 1.5 in regular daytime lighting there is pretty much no difference like the,175.2,621.843,308.87899999999996
Marques Brownlee,v94jRN2FhGo,Phone,Apple,iphone is perfectly capable of crisp detailed natural looking photos when there are no challenges just like every other 800 phone always has been really the only difference i'm seeing is maybe color temperature the iphone 14 can take some occasionally cooler photos and it's noticeable if you have the right colors in the picture but here's a shot from the iphone 14 pro with the 48 megapixel pro raw shot for context here you can actually see a bit of a difference it's a slightly different focal length but also more importantly there's lots more fine detail here and just for fun here's the pixel 6 pro same shot another great detailed photo but just looks like a different style but as expected most of the differences between these that i found were more on the edge cases of normal photography that more challenging or extreme lighting situations mostly in low light and so some of this is enabled by the slightly larger sensor and faster aperture some of this is also enabled by the new image processing pipeline that they've tweaked and fiddled with that they also named photonic engine you know on stage they were saying things like 49 better low light performance which i'm not exactly sure what's meant by 49 like is it 49 faster shutter speed or 49 less noise in low light unclear but as i go through the photos i took on both i gotta say they're still remarkably similar okay again i was looking for the differences in the amount of noise in the shadows or dynamic range but really what i mostly found was slight differences in color temperature you know sometimes one might be a little brighter than the other and sometimes it's really hard to tell them apart even pixel peeping i even looked at shutter speeds which may sometimes reveal that you actually have a faster shutter speed from the bigger sensor because it's taking in more light and while i found that they were nearly the same for every shot the iphone 14 was typically maybe five to ten percent faster the one thing i did find was that in the absolute darkest shots in the worst conditions there was sometimes a difference in how much time it would require to get a night mode exposure like for this one it took 3 seconds from the 13 but 2 seconds from the 14. even though the 13 actually ended up focusing more correctly and had a bit of a sharpness advantage in this shot sometimes you just got to get the shot a little quicker if possible and then this one from the ultrawide it was a one second night mode exposure from the 13 but just a regular snap from the 14. so it's the exact same hardware i guess that's the difference for the photonic engine and image processing even so the image is a toss-up like it's a little more processing happening on the iphone 14 side maybe a little more,329.199,621.843,304.71900000000005
Marques Brownlee,v94jRN2FhGo,Phone,Apple,sharpening a slightly different color cast but that's it and then on the video front it's even more similar so they take basically the same video but the iphone 14 does have a feature called action mode that's not coming to the 13s for some reason even though it feels like a software feature but it's basically a super aggressive stabilization for running around and chasing stuff on top of the already pretty good stabilization from the iphone's video and i will say the stabilization part works very well but the video itself can be quite noisy also it seems like in almost every environment it's just asking for more light all the time like you get this dialog box that says more light required but it still lets you shoot but the footage is super grainy and soft especially from the ultra wide that it defaults to but also like i'm in an incredibly well-lit studio and sometimes it would ask for more light even in here this is better lit than most people's homes where you're chasing around a baby or a pet at 100 miles an hour let alone sometimes going outside on a cloudy day and it's asking for more light that's crazy so this may get better over time as of right now it shows up less on the iphone 14 pro which makes sense because this one has a larger primary sensor but yeah the stabilization works really well it's a software feature you might use and then there is the new selfie camera it is 12 megapixels and has autofocus for the first time instead of the fixed focal distance from before you can get sharper shots in some less conventional selfie situations which is great um it's not game changingly different i mean it's another incremental improvement it can still struggle with properly reproducing darker skin tones which i mentioned in the 14 pro review here's the same shot from the pixel 6 pro which specifically has their real tone optimization so you can see what i mean so at the end of the day what are we left with a super incremental update in the same body basically as before and that's what i want to talk about that they've done a lot more recently some might call it the tim cook logistics touch see that's been the iphone se formula for years i've talked about it in those reviews so the first generation iphone se comes out it's basically the body of an old iphone 5s but with new internals then the second generation iphone se comes out it's the body of an iphone 8 but with new internals and then the third generation iphone sc again that we just got this year again is the body of an iphone 8 but even newer internals and there's rumors of the next gen sc being like the body of an iphone 10r but the new chip and we even saw that with the macbook pro this year the 13-inch m2 macbook pro is the exact same body as the 13-inch m1,481.919,621.843,319.44200000000006
Marques Brownlee,v94jRN2FhGo,Phone,Apple,macbook pro just with better internals now it's not exactly some mystery why they do this there's plenty of reasons behind the scenes why these things are good for apple it reduces risk it reduces cost because now you don't have to develop as much new stuff and then prices go down and you can offer something more tried and true that already worked in the past but to an audience that will pay less and also it sort of insulates them a little bit from the supply chain challenges of trying to make a bunch of newer stuff so the innovation aka the risk is saved for the even more expensive phones you know you watch that iphone 14 pro review and you see the dynamic island which is a thing that's new to the iphone it'll evolve over time you see the new 48 megapixel camera system which is new to the iphone and you'll see the always on display which again is the first time they've done this basically this is all just a long-winded way of saying the baseline iphone with this strategy is just boring and that's just the way it is uh so now for those who are thinking of actually buying one of these phones you're thinking oh okay i know everything about the phones i know which one i want to get but one last wrench to throw into all of this is that the iphone 13 is still on sale and it's 6.99 from apple but you can probably find it even cheaper from other places and i think that would be a fine upgrade for a lot of people like the one extra year of software updates is maybe the only reason i would get a 14 over a 13 but aside from that you really got to think about how much the new colors or the slightly new camera or satellite connectivity or crash detection actually means to you and hey if efficiency means something to you then definitely check out this video's sponsor anchor who makes these chargers and cables that i really like this is their nano 3 charger which uses gallium nitride that's why it's 70 smaller than apple's 30 watt charger and it's still powerful enough to juice up an iphone or an ipad or a macbook air if you really wanted to and this 541 cable which is usbc to lightning is the first that i've seen that uses bio-based materials in the cable so sugar cane and corn but it's still a high quality cable that can withstand up to 20 000 bends and it's actually more durable than a typical plastic cable and these both come in five colors for your choice to either match your iphone 14 or mix it up a little bit definitely check both of these out at the link below but that's been it thanks for watching let me know what you think of apple's this repackaging re-gifting strategy that they've sort of leaned into more lately either way it's september a lot more is coming up definitely subscribe if you haven't already and i'll catch you guys the next one peace [Music],641.36,621.843,331.29799999999994
Marques Brownlee,BS8x2TicxQ8,Phone,Google,"- So a common phrase in the video world is, eh, we'll fix it in post. Meaning the shot isn't quite perfect, but we'll just fix that stuff in post-production, kinda like this. (drums rolling) (magical music) There you go. Or how about a little bit of this too? (drums rolling) (magical music) There we go, much better. See, it's not that it's a lazy way of doing it, but I feel like a good filmmaker tries to get as reliably good in camera as possible instead of relying on software. And the we'll fix it in post version of a smartphone is definitely the Google Pixel. So many of the Pixel's best features are literally fixing it in post, right? Oh, is your face blurry in that picture you took? Fine, Face Unblur. Fix it in post. Oh, what's that? You didn't quite get that angle right on your photo? Magic Editor. Fix it in post. Oh, was there a weird background audio in that video you took? Easy, we got Audio Eraser, fix it in post, and many of these strategies with a little help from AI, actually work and that's where the Pixel shines. But there's also some things about smartphones that you kind of just can't really fix in post. First things first. The design on the outside of these phones looks, I would say, familiar. It looks like the past few years of Pixel which I actually really like, but I also do think this one's a little bit better in a few ways. First of all, the camera circles did the iPhone Dynamic Island thing of combining themselves into one big circle which I actually like with these new bigger sensors here. And then also the Pro Pixels now have a completely flat display, so finally moving away from the slightly curved edges from the past years and a satin back in every color which does a shockingly good job at hiding fingerprints, if your team know case like I am. Aside from that though, everything else is right where you'd expect it. The one thing I wanna see if maybe they can fix now is the dust that always accumulates like right under and above the camera bar. Probably the only way to get rid of that is to sort of curve it like they did on the Oppo Find X4 and X3, but I don't know if they'll ever do that. But the biggest improvement to the hardware though is definitely upfront, honestly to the point where I feel like these new screens sort of tie the phone together in a way that they're up at the level of any other flagship phone. So the smaller Pixel 8 now has a 6.2-inch 1080P OLED display, slightly smaller than last year. And that display is surrounded now by perfectly thin even bezels all the way around, no more tiny chin like previous years. And it's now bumped up to 120 hertz display that gets up to a new maximum 2,000 nits of brightness which is incredible. It's super bright. They're naming it the Actua display because they feel the need to name everything. But I love how it's visible all the time. Auto brightness has also been behaving this time around which is great. It's not LTPO though, so you'll still probably wanna turn off the always on display to save a bit of battery. But then the Pixel 8 Pro has a new 6.7-inch display. It is LTPO, it's closer to 1440P",0.26,621.843,178.33600000000013
Marques Brownlee,BS8x2TicxQ8,Phone,Google,"and it maxes out at 2,400 nits max brightness. This one is legitimately up there with the brightest displays I've ever seen on a smartphone in person and I definitely did not expect that to come from a Pixel. They're naming this the Super Actua display. So the result is a hardware package on the outside of the phone that honestly feels like you can put it right up alongside any flagships from Xiaomi, Samsung, or anyone else, you name it. Just from the way it's built, the way it feels, the metal rails, the satin back, the clickiness of the buttons, the super bright display, the even bezels, everything about it, it's just this is a rare W for Pixel hardware. And then two other small things about this display, though. One, it's still just a single front-facing camera at the top but Google has found a way with software to get more information out of this camera in order to be able to use it for secure unlock for things like banking apps and logging into things. So basically instead of adding more hardware up front like an infrared camera or a dot projector or radar, if you remember that, they just fix it in post with software magic and it's convenient. But then number two, the fingerprint reader has not improved. So remember we were talking about this in the past few years of Pixels, all the best, the highest end flagships feels like they all have that super fast ultrasonic fingerprint reader. This one is still optical and still just a little bit, just a beat slower than the high end ones. It's not horrible, but you can tell it's not as fast or as consistently accurate with like rain on your phone as something like a Samsung phone. It's also not any bigger, either. But hey, as long as we're talking about the Pixel, we might as well just get right into talking about the camera because this is where you're gonna see the fix it in post pushed to its absolute maximum, more than any other phone. So the new camera sensors across the board, they do plenty of heavy lifting, of course, it's a big 50-megapixel primary sensor shared across both the 8 and the 8 Pro, F1.7 OIS and Pixel photos, they look good, they're sharp, there's tons of dynamic range as expected. Auto focus is really fast and it can get a pretty shallow depth of field with close up subjects, which is nice. But really most of what you're looking at when you look at a Pixel photo or video is software. So the multiple exposures blended together into a single HDR shot, the strategic relighting of recognized faces. I also, I do feel like there's a little extra noise reduction this year. So sometimes details get kind of watercolory but at least there's enough resolution that it doesn't look terrible when zoomed out. And I've also found there is definitely a tendency to over-HDR some images sometimes. And when it comes to features, well, oh my god, there are so many now. You probably already know about Magic Eraser. Look, oh, what's that? You've taken a photo and someone's in the background, you wanna get rid of 'em. Boom, Magic Eraser, fix it in post. Oh, what's that? You have a photo where someone's moving a little too fast or the hands were shaky and the face is kind of blurry. Well, there's a feature called Face Unblur, literally fix it in post. And then even this new one called The Best Take, people with kids are gonna love this one. Basically, you know how anytime you take a group photo where there's like five or six people in the photo, you just blast, you just take a bunch of pictures and inevitably, one person's face, they're either blinking or sneezing or something. It's never perfect.",181.86,621.843,192.22300000000004
Marques Brownlee,BS8x2TicxQ8,Phone,Google,"But this feature will let you go into that group shot. And this is for any group shot you've ever taken in your Google Photos library, by the way, not just a shot on the Pixel. And it automatically recognizes the burst of photos and lets you pick the best face from the whole burst on each person in the photo with surprisingly impressive accuracy. You will genuinely never have that one person with their eyes closed or looking the wrong way in a group photo ever again. I guess that makes your holiday cards that much easier. But also even in videos, you know, I've taken a lot of videos on the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, there's a lot of processing happening. I do think Pixel video is improved over last year. It's less noisy in the shadows and there's some nice shallow depth of field with quick autofocus. I shot almost the entire Corvette Z06 autofocus video on the Pixel 8 Pro and I think it looks really good, but also in a lot of the shots of my face, there's this artificial brightening processing, like you can see it in my footage before I start talking. When it lands on my face, how it just brightens up my face and adds this contrast and just throughout the footage, there is a good amount of processed sharpening going on. Also, the Audio Eraser video feature is all right, I would say. Again, you can only fix so much in post, but basically they show this feature where if you're taking videos and there's some background noise, you can go into the editor and separate out like the layers of different sounds. So there's this really cool UI that they've built in that is super impressive. You go into Edit Audio and Audio Eraser. It analyzes the video and then lets you drag up or down levels of different sounds it's identified. So nature and voices and background sounds and wind, you know, depends on what video you took. It does okay with small stuff, but like, I don't know, it's super impressive at a low level, but then it can't really save the most disruptive wind around our studio or the exhaust sound of a five and a half liter naturally aspirated V8. Like it's not magic. About this in the main channel in the Rimac Nevera video. That car is electric and basically has multiple personalities and this one kind of does in the same way. You've probably heard the other cliche of. I will say shout out to the colors though. Honestly the color in Pixel video is really good. If you told me I could only take pictures by taking stills from video of any smartphone, I think I would pick the Pixel 8 Pro. Just the footage looks so good. Now Google, here's the thing about being so good at software visibly is it becomes way more obvious when you're suddenly not able to pull off a software trick on the non-Pro phone that you are able to pull off on the Pro phone, even though they're the same computer. Like the good thing that you did was put the same exact chip the Tensor G3 with the same image signal processor and the same primary camera and the same selfie camera in the pro and the non-Pro phones. So this sort of artificial separation between the Pro and the non-Pro with like software locking, it was obvious when Apple did it and it's even more obvious when Google does it. So if you open up the camera and switch over to Pro Controls, that's only available on the Pro phone. Now, that's funny. Of course, you can argue the non-Pro phone doesn't need Pro controls, but it's clearly capable of them. Even if you bury them in settings, it's the same computer. They also both have a 50-megapixel sensor, but because it's locked under the Pro mode, you can only take 50-megapixel shots on the Pro phone. The non-Pro phone is always binning. Theoretically that's gonna be one of the things",374.363,621.843,214.7799999999999
Marques Brownlee,BS8x2TicxQ8,Phone,Google,"that you'll have to pay the 300 extra dollars to get up to the Pro phone for, but also someone's already ported it to the Pixel 6. So like, come on, Google, you ain't slick. There's even a blog post about some other features that are coming to the Pixel. They have this thing called Zoom Enhance. That's basically a generative fill version of Super Res Zoom that's coming later this year only to Pixel 8 Pro for some reason. And especially improved MagicERraser version that uses Generative Fill on the 8 Pro and only the 8 Pro. - It's ridiculous. It's obvious what's being done out here. It's a nightly basis. I hope the world can see now what's really going on out here 'cause it's getting ridiculous. It's really ridiculous. - Okay, last camera thing. Magic Editor is... It's wild. It's one of the wildest things they've ever made. It is available on both phones and it definitely goes beyond fixing it in post. So you open up a photo, you hit Edit, and then at the bottom left corner, there's this wonderful colorful rainbow Magic Editor button just tempting you to press it. From here, the editor UI is basically saying, all right, go ahead and select something with your hands and then we can change it. We can do whatever you want to it. Select an object and you can remove it, move it around, resize it, select a person, we can move 'em up or down or hit the bottom middle button to switch the whole scene to golden hour or replace the entire sky in your photo. And then once you submit the edit it takes a few seconds to process, and then kind of like DALL·E, it gives you four options of this edit to pick whichever version is the most convincing. They're not, you know, professional photographer level edits meaning you can zoom in and Pixel peep and find some edges sometimes that look weird here or there. I also did try the exact same Generative Fill example that they showed in their commercials of this kid on a park bench where it oppressively fills in the missing balloons. When I do it, it kind of tries to do that, but definitely doesn't do it nearly as well. But the truth is zoomed all the way out, these are decently convincing edits to regular people and you can just do it with any photo in your library, so it really just feels like without knowing how to use Photoshop or any of these image generation AI tools, the Pixel Magic Editor, basically what it did is just it lowered the barrier to entry to just lie I guess. Now every once in a while, I did get a popup box over my edit attempt that said it's unable to show results because it might violate our gen AI terms. But I was never able to find like exactly why or any trend in this. It seemed to come up more often when I tried to edit a picture of a person, but then it would totally let me just select a watermark in a photo and effortlessly delete that, which is probably gonna be concern for some photographers. So yeah, I would just say that I'm probably gonna end up making an entire separate video just about this tool 'cause it's fascinating and what it brings into the world is wild. But I don't know. What is a photo? But you know what you can't fix in post, though? Battery life. You can't AI your way out of a huge 2,400 nit screen burning through battery. You're just gonna need the hardware, you're gonna need a big battery you're gonna need an efficient chip for this one. And I'm happy to report that I have had really good battery life on the Pixels.",590.07,621.843,198.02000000000004
Marques Brownlee,BS8x2TicxQ8,Phone,Google,"And this is especially on the 8 Pro. So I've gotten six to eight hours of screen on time regularly, standby time has been decent. My only real question at this point is, and I only ask this because of the history we've seen with the Pixel, how long will the battery life be this good? Because, you know, it could be great for a few months and then start to fade like previous Pixels, or maybe it'll be great for years, the whole time you own the phone. Only time will tell. At the end of the day though, the Pixel is still great at what it's always been great at, which is being smart. Like there are so many features, from call screening, to Google Assistant everywhere, Google's stock apps getting so good. And the more I use the Pixel as my daily phone, as I have for so long, the more I just kind of get used to this stuff and the harder it is to live without it on another phone. Android 14 has already breathed life into older pixels already. Literally my biggest primary bug is clicking Twitter notifications, for some reason, Just take an extra beat and a half to open. Kind of weird. One of the new features on this one is when you're in any webpage in Chrome, you can pull up Google Assistant and just ask it for a summary of the entire webpage you're reading. And Google Assistant with this new AI features reads your screen and generates a summary of three or four bullet points that are typically pretty good. Now I wanna try this with a few other apps, but I basically always got an error saying this app doesn't support summaries, So it looks like the app developers are gonna have to opt in to have their apps scraped by the summaries which I kind of suspect a lot of them are not gonna do that. Even Google's own news app doesn't support it. So this basically is just a Chrome thing. And then after the summary, it gives you a few cards to ask follow up questions about the subject and just keep Googling more stuff. But then just this phone gets a lot of the little stuff right too. Just the little things that make it feel like a flagship. The haptics are excellent. Like it's got some of the highest quality phone calls I've ever heard on a phone, stuff like that. Overall, when you put fit and finish and hardware up alongside software experience, and I think these new screens especially, it feels like this is finally the generation of Pixel that is right alongside the other flagships of the smartphone world. And it gets supported like a flagship too. Seven years of software updates, seven years of feature drop updates, seven years of security updates, seven years of spare parts available. And it'll do so for the new starting price of $700. And I think it's worth it. I honestly, I think this is worth the new price tag. I think everything they've done from the 120 hertz and the brighter screen across the board, this is a phone that I would have no problem recommending. Now, is the 300 extra dollars for the Pro worth it? That one's gonna be tough. And again, it's because Google did such a good job with feature parity, same chip, same primary camera between these, so it's gonna come down to the couple of small differences between them. Do you want that telephoto camera and the bigger screen, bigger battery, bigger phone, the temperature sensor? I don't know. It's harder to recommend the Pro for most people, but the Pixel 8, this is a good phone. So that's basically it. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (light music)",788.85,621.843,184.47699999999998
Marques Brownlee,KZA_BIa8e7I,Phone,Google,"- Hey guys, Google had an event today where they completely surprised us by announcing the totally out of the blue Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, and the Pixel Watch too that somehow never leaked. It just completely caught us off guard. I hope you can detect my sarcasm through the internet, but hey, we dig an event and it has some stuff that I was really looking forward to, Pixel 8 and 8 Pro mostly because I've been a Pixel fan even though I know it has these big flaws like the Tensor G2 had subpar performance and the somewhat average battery life. But like I still like the Pixel and there's a lot that I was looking forward to for the next stuff. So, they delivered on a lot of that stuff but it also comes with a new price. So, okay, on the outside Pixel 8 and 8 Pro do still look like Pixels, right? I told you they were sticking with this design language with the visor because it's very recognizable and they finally have that going for them. But this year it just feels like they rounded everything off like that's the big visible design update this year, everything's a bit more rounded. And then there's the new colors. Now, honestly, I'm just gonna say it. I think it's been a pretty boring year for phone colors across the board, just putting it out there. But with this one it's Hazel, Rose, and Obsidian for the Pixel 8 and then Obsidian, Porcelain, and this new blue color called Bay. I think the blue is probably the most interesting of the whole lineup combined with the new matte finish that's on the back of all the Pros. I love that. I think it might be my favorite alongside Matte Black. Maybe it's a toss up between the two. But then around the front both displays have actually gotten better. So the bezels are a bit thinner and they look pretty uniform all the way around to me. And then they're both dramatically brighter up to 2,000 nits peak brightness on the Pixel 8 and 2,400 nits on the 8 Pro. I think that's the highest I've ever seen in a phone. So, I think it should look really good both indoors and outdoors. And then also the smaller Pixel 8 is now 120 hertz as well. Love that. I know people love just dismissing 120 hertz on cheaper phones but we're there. Now it's not LTPO yet, that's still just the pro. But yeah, just looking at these screens for the limited time that I spent with them I'm very excited to get them out in the real world. They're calling it an Actua Display and a Super Actua Display. Not sure why, but I guess you gotta name everything. But anyway, this year the really big physical change we're getting with these phones I'm gonna say is the new Tensor G3 chip. So, it's the new third generation of Google Silicon paired with eight gigs of RAM on the Pixel 8 and 12 gigs of RAM on the Pixel 8 Pro. And to be honest, Google didn't really talk that much about, or at least flex very much of like just raw performance improvements. Like it's not really about that. I'm gonna have to test these phones",0.06,621.843,159.38999999999996
Marques Brownlee,KZA_BIa8e7I,Phone,Google,"to see if they actually improved a lot as far as CPU and GPU, and just overall power. So definitely get subscribed to be first to see those reviews when they come out. Also here are the battery sizes, the new batteries of these new phones. They're both a tiny bit bigger than last year. But really the story with the Tensor G3 is there is way more TPU and way more processing power for AI-related tasks and that checks out because the Pixel story has always been all about the software, and that's still super true with these. There is so much software. Like the Pixel is basically the smartest smartphone in the room. It's not going to wow you with amazing numbers or incredible build quality, or huge hardware features or anything like that. It's gonna wow you with very clever software at every corner. So here we're talking there's a new Google Assistant feature where if you're on a webpage in Chrome you can ask the assistant to summarize the webpage for you and then using the same tech, I imagine that's in Google Bard, it'll quickly give you a three or four bullet point summary that's hopefully accurate. A speech-to-text is also now even faster and more accurate. It's completely on device and does a much better job also at knowing that ums and uhs are not part of your actual sentence, so it doesn't write them down. That's smart. They're doing more stuff with the front facing camera to make stuff like face unlock and unlocking stuff in apps more secure. There's also a new fix-it feature which will proofread your messages built into the keyboard before you send them with things like grammar and all that. One of the crazy ones is the new call screen voice. So if you've used a Pixel you know about call screen before which is you're getting a call, it's an unknown number. You just let the Google Assistant screen the call. The new one has a much more human voice that I honestly don't really know if it's a robot voice or just a recording of a human but it's much more human sounding. And then also it has the chips that pop up that you can hit to respond to people that are now context aware. So if it listens to somebody say, ""Hey, I'm a UPS driver."" You can now hit a button that immediately says, ""Oh, you can leave the package at the doorstep."" I got to record this. I'll just let you listen to it. - [Google Assistant] Hi, I'm a Google Virtual Calling Assistant recording this call on behalf of the person you're trying to reach. Can you say what you're calling about? - [Courier] I'm trying to drop off a package for Kenny. (no audio) - [Google Assistant] They said you can go ahead and leave the package by the front door. (no audio) - [Courier] Okay, thanks. That's great. (no audio) - [Google Assistant] Great, I'll see you soon. (beeps) - So yeah, that's pretty good to me. It sounds very human, but again, I don't know, it could just literally be a human recording. Either way, it says it's a virtual assistant. But what would a Pixel be without some camera magic?",159.45,621.843,159.54399999999995
Marques Brownlee,KZA_BIa8e7I,Phone,Google,"So, let's just jump into the new camera stuff with the Pixel 'cause there's a lot of software magic here, lot of software magic. So the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro now share the same upgraded 50 megapixel main camera system. Then the 8 also has a 12 megapixel ultra wide but the 8 Pro just sends it all the way with a 48 megapixel ultra wide and a 48 megapixel 5x telephoto. And I also really like the new camera app layout which is now separated basically into photo and video mode. And then all the various settings and modes are inside of each. So I think it makes a lot of intuitive sense. You could just switch to photo and then go to a specific photo mode. There's manual controls. It's not the first time I've seen it laid out this way but when you get so much stuff happening in the camera you don't wanna move it out or hide it, you just need to sort of organize it in a capable way. I think this does a good job. So I'll have to save my photo and video quality analysis for the full review. But like I said, there's a lot of software features that they've added that just seem, they just get more and more wild as you go on. So the really insane one is the Magic Editor. So you've probably already seen, you can erase people from the background of photos with Magic Eraser but now this Magic Editor will let you straight up select subjects and just move them around, and completely alter the entire photo with just a few taps. So they showed me this example of like moving a subject to a different spot in a photo on the beach but there's also all kinds of other demos of like changing the sky or changing shadows or all kinds of other stuff. Honestly, it seems like nothing is off limits. And then there's also a feature I didn't get footage of but it's called Best Take, which is like when you're taking a photo of like a group of a bunch of people and you're like, ""All right everybody, try to smile at the same time."" And you take a bunch of photos but there's always somebody blinking in one of them. It's never perfect with everyone's faces. You probably see where this is going. So Google detects that you're taking a burst photo of a bunch of people and it will take all of those together, and give you the ability to tap on people's faces and change them to a different instance of a different face that they're making at a different time just to stitch together this Frankenstein photo with everyone having perfect faces even though it's a moment that never happened. What is a photo? (chuckles) But then there's another one called Audio Eraser. It's a video editing feature. It's just on the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro but you can actually use it on any video you've ever taken in your library. But that literally just erases background sounds from like a video of a subject. It supposedly works really well, I gotta test this on more stuff but the one they showed me worked amazingly well. And all of this is basically along the theme of awesome software magic enabled by Tensor G3. Like all of the neural cores and all the things that it's doing with AI processing is what's enabling all of this awesome, weird, fancy software magic stuff. And then there's two other little things",323.28,621.843,165.50999999999993
Marques Brownlee,KZA_BIa8e7I,Phone,Google,"that didn't really fit into the rest of this video but one is there's a new hole on the back of the Pro phone as you could probably see, and that is a temperature sensor. Yeah. Actually. So, there's a new thermometer app on the phone and when you open it, it asks you to select a material to measure the surface temperature of I guess to be the most accurate. So you pick your material and then you just get up close to your subject like within two inches of it and tap to measure, and you get your temperature, which is it works. It's pretty neat I guess. I don't know that I would use this very much. You may also notice that humans are missing from the object selection menu because measuring human temperature is still awaiting FDA approval. Maybe that'll get added to the menu when it gets approved later this year. Although I guess technically you could just tell it you're a ceramic or like a hot liquid or something and measure yourself anyway. I don't know. Whatever. There's a temperature sensor now on the 8 Pro. And but the other thing is number two, the haptics. Oh my god, I was typing on these phones and this is like the number one thing I noticed on the 8 Pro is the haptics are so much stronger. I mean I was just poking around the UI and scrolling a bunch, but especially when I was typing, the haptics are super strong and really refined. So there's a difference between strong haptics and like clean, refined haptics. This was both and I think that's super underrated. I don't know if they're gonna mention this or put it in the marketing materials at all but I just love the haptics from the hour or two that I spent with this phone. All right, quick interjection. There's actually one more thing I wanted to mention with these that's called Video Boost and it's one of the weirdest, I don't even know if I can call it a software feature actually but it's one of the weirdest things yet. So first of all, it's only available on the Pro Pixel. Second of all, it doesn't actually launch with the phone. It's coming soon or later. But basically what it is is you take some video on your Pixel and it looks okay at first but then you have it uploaded to the cloud where it then processes overnight or for a few hours and then comes back to you with a result that looks dramatically better, better HDR plus better color grading, and looks much better than the video you originally took. I don't know why it's only on the Pro phone. I don't know why it has to upload to other servers. I don't even know what's happening. It's just this weird video magic feature. It's called Video Boost. We'll see what happens if it actually comes out by review time but just wanted to throw that in there. Another weird feature. So then the new prices. So, Pixel 8 is gonna start at 699 which is a hundred bucks more than last year. And then the Pixel 8 Pro is gonna start at 999. I think you can justify it though. I mean the base Pixel just got upgraded to 120 Hertz display",488.79,621.843,160.59000000000006
Marques Brownlee,KZA_BIa8e7I,Phone,Google,"to a much brighter display with thinner bezels, to the Tensor G3 that's got a new primary camera that's the same as a more expensive phone. So I still feel like that's a fair price for it even though it's not the bargain of the year like it was before. And then the other massive update that's for both of these phones, this is awesome, is seven years of OS security and feature drop updates for the 8 and 8 Pro. Seven years which seems like something they probably should have already been doing with Google's own phone running Google's own chips and Google's own software. But yeah, that's, think about that. That's pretty sick. They're leading the way. This is a phone that's gonna get its last software update in 2030. (snaps fingers) Good looks, Google. But also, yeah, they announced an update to the Pixel Watch 2. It is in the same super sleek pebble design so it's gonna look the same from the outside. But now inside there's a new quad core processor that should speed things up significantly and also potentially extend the battery life by a little bit 'cause they're promising 24 hours but with always on display on now instead of off. And there's a bunch of newly redesigned apps like Gmail and calendar. And then it just felt like they added a bunch of stuff that we also recently saw added to the Apple Watch. So there's a new safety check feature that works almost exactly like the one Apple just announced. They also added a skin temperature sensor that can be helpful for monitoring patterns. They also now have auto workout start and stop detection and they also added backup and restore, which actually other watches have had for a while and they should have had this ages ago but they also now have that. If you look at the back of the watch, there's a bunch of improved sensors that should better monitor heart rate and health data while you're moving around a lot more vigorously. And this watch will launch at the same price that last year's did so 349 for the wifi only and 399 starting for the LTE watch. And that's a pretty good spot for our segue to the sponsor of this video, which is the Dbrand Ghost Case. They're gonna make one for these new Pixels, Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, so you can see that matte finish or that new color through the case while keeping it protected and that even though it doesn't have G2 wireless charging like it was rumored that they might, that didn't stop Dbrand from just putting a MagSafe compatible ring on the back anyway. And I also kinda like what they did with the question mark design compared to the classic Apple MagSafe layout. But also I like the fact that Dbrand says the Ghost Case will never turn yellow unlike every other clear case. So, if you wanna pick up a ghost which will never turn yellow, I'll leave link below. And so that's it. Let me know what you guys wanna see in the reviews of each of these devices, the phones, the watches because my name is Marques Brownlee and it is Techtober officially and there's gonna be a bunch of videos in the next couple weeks. So, stay tuned for that stuff. Get subscribed. All right, catch you in the next one. Peace. (uptempo music)",649.38,621.843,165.74000000000004
Marques Brownlee,LRJPk9BmJY4,Phone,Google,[Music] first of all can we talk about something for a second Google is the worst company on Earth at keeping things a secret and I don't think it's on purpose like some people think it's an intentional leak and oh they're they're letting stuff get out about their phone so that's free press no I think they're just bad at it like really really bad at it so everything about the phone is already out before it even comes out that's just the way it is with pixel phones now pixel anything anyway this is the pixel 7A you've probably heard about it or seen some things uh and it turns out pretty much everything you've seen is true because it's a pixel but really what you should know is this is the new mid-ranger from Google and it's a bit more expensive than the previous one 7A costs 499 and it's very similar to the pixel 7. let's talk about it so first things first yes the price did go up the pixel 6A was 449 that release this is the 7A so there should be a good reason to add 50 more dollars so let's just start with what's new which is wireless charging and a new 90 Hertz display honestly these are welcome features wireless charging is a nice one for convenience I will say it's definitely not fast wireless charging it's only seven and a half Watts here so I've noticed literally when I'm navigating and this is wireless charging in my car and it's got high brightness GPS stuff going it just holds its charge it doesn't lower or go up it just stays the same but hey if you have a wireless charger sitting around at the desk at work or at the bedside or something like that it'll definitely be good for a trickle charge overnight which not every phone in this price range can say they have so that's good and then the 90 Hertz display is a funny one because it's actually off by default on this phone like when you first take it out the box and start using it it's a 60 hertz phone but you can go into the display settings and turn turn on smooth display suddenly it's 50 percent more frames and it's dramatically smoother about as smooth as the pixel 7 was it's also the same tensor G2 chip and the same 8 gigs of RAM so performance feels pretty similar to the pixel 7 at 90 Hertz it makes a big difference I do not enjoy using this phone at 60 hertz for,0.73,621.843,257.20899999999995
Marques Brownlee,LRJPk9BmJY4,Phone,Google,this price it did seem a little bit choppier like it was dropping frames and actually operating at 45 to 55 Hertz so yeah turn on that 90 Hertz build quality wise that is where you'll see at least on paper it does take the small step down from the pixel 7. uh plastic back and the the rails are still metal which is nice and it is also IP67 instead of ip68 but honestly you'd be hard-pressed to notice just like using this phone holding it there's no creaking no bending no nothing screams low quality about this build at all so I think that was well done and this is a slightly smaller 6.1 inch flat display still 1080P and it's up to 90 Hertz like I said and it does have some serious color shifting and banding when you get off axis but honestly you know it's still bright it still looks good enough for this price it's Gorilla Glass 3 and also even though the display is slightly smaller the slightly thicker bezels just bring it right back up to basically the same size of a phone as the pixel 7. so it feels like another fair trade and then there is a new set of colors this This little light blue is called c as in Ocean it's the C but there's also a charcoal and snow which are the black and white ones and there's also a red like coral colored one that one is an online only Google Store color pretty fire actually but you know Channel sponsored dbrand will let you spice it up I've never actually shouted out the Jerry rig everything tear down skin because usually dbrand has to wait for someone to actually do the tear down luckily though they were able to pull some strings and get this one made ahead of time so it's ready right for launch and this is a rare first look at the inside of the phone on camera through this skin and it's it's 15 off too along with everything else on their site right now for you guys as long as you go to dbrand.com MKBHD and use code everything but bottom line it still very much looks like a pixel the metal wraparound visor the pill cut out for the cameras the antenna bands in the right places the slot speakers the buttons are still very clicky I mean if this is they've done the hardware well this is a very good trade-off for the hardware price and then do I really even need to get into the software because this story kind of writes itself they do all the same,129.599,621.843,268.74100000000004
Marques Brownlee,LRJPk9BmJY4,Phone,Google,software stuff in the a series phones as they do on the more premium pixels which I like not everybody does that so all the same features all the same stuff that I like about every other pixel is also here I've called the pixel the smartest smartphone in the world because of how good Google assistant is how good the voice to text is with all the on-device transcription the incredible voice recorder app the Google Assistant stuff that screens calls and waits on hold for me the now playing feature that hears songs in the background wherever you go and identifies them for you the material you stuff throughout everything that identifies your wallpaper and matches your system colors to it and of course the promised three years of software updates which hilariously isn't the longest promise support in the industry anymore that actually goes to Samsung's phones which promise like four to five years of support but nevertheless no surprises here so really my only two question marks when I got this phone were battery and cameras so battery would be kind of interesting because it's roughly the same size battery as the pixel 7 so would it have the same battery life or not but then also cameras because For the first time in a while there's new cameras in here all new cameras that we've never seen in a pixel before so a departure from the tried and true so first for battery 4 385 milliamp hours 18 watt charging kind of slow and seven and a half watt wireless charging even slower and then total battery life I'm gonna say average at best so it's a full day of use but definitely nothing more even at 90 Hertz which is fine you know it's mid-range so I got quite a few days with the the three to four hours of screen on time at 90 Hertz with my typical usage and I'd have like 10 left at the end of the day so I'm not really worried about it dying before the end of the day unless it's crazy heavy but even then the wireless charging can kind of save you if you want to prolong its death a little bit we'll see how this ages over time but for now I'm giving it a c plus battery life if that makes sense but let's talk about these cameras okay so pixel 6A last year played it super safe with the cameras because it used the same 12 megapixel sensor from the previous like four years of pixels in a row that,263.88,621.843,266.57899999999995
Marques Brownlee,LRJPk9BmJY4,Phone,Google,Infamous IMX 363 sensor that did so well this one has a brand new 64 megapixel main camera paired with a 13 megapixel Ultra wide and a 13 megapixel selfie camera so when I first started testing it I mean I'm thinking all right well this new sensor keep up with the old tried and true pixel 6A because we all know how good those old cameras were but pretty quickly it became clear that Google has done the work to tighten up the processing with the new sensor and actually sort of match it this time and take advantage of the actual larger sensor so it's not just about the megapixel count matter of fact this 64 megapixel sensor bins down to 16 megapixels by default every time and there is no way in Google's app to take full 64 megapixel photos but it's more about the larger size of the sensor which can bring in more light and give a more shallow natural depth of field so yeah pixel photos look pretty good for a 500 phone there are tons of dynamic range without being too hdre and actually kind of feels like they've evened it out a little bit so it's a little less contrasty but it still has that famous contrasty pixel look and then that F 1.9 Max aperture combined with the new sensor means you can take close-ups of things and have a really shallow depth of field and you can take better low-light photos with faster shutter speeds at night with night sight there is no macro mode I noticed but you can get pretty close up probably I'm gonna say like five inches away from the subject and still be fine not too much fringing the ultra wide here has a lot of the same characteristics but it's particularly distorted and warped at the corners I feel like this this is something like I would expect Google to improve more with their software maybe they'll update this over time but for now the Distortion look is pretty noticeable but it is wide and then the Selfies they look like pixel selfies honestly very solid no complaints tons of range that's a good selfie camera for video you can do 4K 60 from the main camera which the Samsung a54 I just tested I don't think could even do that but then it's 4K 30 from the other cameras which is fine looks normal it this is a top three mid-range smartphone camera but hold on to that,396.36,621.843,267.18100000000004
Marques Brownlee,LRJPk9BmJY4,Phone,Google,thought all the rest of the little parts of this phone I've tested were right in line for this price the haptics were pretty good not as good as the more expensive pixels but pretty good the optical fingerprint reader is just a beat slower than the super fast ultrasonic ones but none of the pixels have particularly fast fingerprint readers anyway so this is par for the course and when the sun hit it I could also see that it was slightly angled to the right not sure if that's normal or not I just know I haven't seen it like that before but let's be real here for the a series it all comes down to the price point and this one has gone up so it is still mid-range but it's like upper like premium mid-range at 500 bucks Verizon is also going to sell a millimeter wave version and theirs will be 550 bucks classic Verizon but still premium mid-range right this is a good phone and I think a lot of people will get it and really like it but for the price I would actually rather go for the pixel 7. it is six months older yes than this brand new a series phone but it's gonna have the same specs it's the same tensor chip and same RAM and everything but it will have more capable cameras on the back and the front a faster 20 watt wireless charging and then a bunch of the smaller little things better haptics better speakers and a cheaper phone it's actually glass on the back like there's just a bunch of little things that add up to a better experience overall it's thinner bezels better accessories because it's six months old already it's also ip68 instead of IP67 and this phone is like 5.99 standard and it was when it came out but it's regularly on sale for much less than that if you can get this phone pixel 7 for in the 500 to 550 range I would take this over the 7A but I guess that's just the middle child effect because Google is now trying this sort of newer thing where they're offering more things at once more pixels for different prices they're keeping the 6A in the lineup at 349 which I think is a really good deal and so now you can get a pixel anywhere from 350 bucks to 1800 bucks choice is yours 7A is kind of right in the middle let me know what you think about this phone and whether or not you'd get this or the older seven in the meantime thanks for watching check out all the new stuff on the channel if you haven't already and I'll catch you guys in the next one peace,531.06,621.843,280.29800000000006
Marques Brownlee,NE5H5intsck,Phone,Google,foreign [Music] pixel sevens seven and seven per I'm using these songs for about a week now and yes they are very similar to last year they're the same prices too but more than ever this year and you can see it at every corner the pixel special is software solutions to Hardware problems and this is in contrast to say the Samsung or the xiaomi special which is throw as much raw Hardware horsepower at the thing as possible there's just no way that isn't better than before and there's nothing right or wrong with either of these approaches matter of fact as a Tech head you can kind of appreciate both but there is there is just a little bit of a magic to this software way at least when it works so yeah I can definitely appreciate the slightly updated Hardware on the outside of the pixel because even though it isn't super important to the Google Mission it's still important to the users so initially with my very first Hands-On I didn't love it but it's kind of growing on me the main change here being the metal camera bar instead of the All Glass visor from last year it lets them do some interesting stuff with the colors but most importantly lets them make it all one piece of metal all the way around with the frame of the rest of the phone it's polished aluminum on the pro and matte aluminum on the pixel 7. then both phones also get brighter displays up to 1500 nits Peak on the 7 Pro and 1400 nits on the regular pixel 7. can't fake that with software and then the 7 Pro display is larger slightly curved over the edges and a generally better looking display with less off-axis rainbowing but interestingly it's set to 1080p out the box by default even though it's a 1440p panel I immediately switched that to 1440 and have had no battery issues so I recommend doing that matter of fact might as well just say it right off the top I have had great battery experiences with these phones I've been mostly dailying the 7 Pro David at the studio has been dailying the seven and yeah they've been excellent like just this morning today drove into the studio had an hour-long commute with Waze on full brightness GPS streaming Spotify audio through Bluetooth to the car got here with like 85 battery left and I'm consistently ending days with 30 to 40 percent six to seven hours is not a problem uh yeah I've had very good battery life on these phones very impressive that's a combination of software optimization better modems just better chip overall but speaking of chips inside the phone there are very few new specs but the new second generation tensor G2 from Google is one of them there's also a little bit extra RAM on the pro phone it does Benchmark a bit higher than the first tensor but in terms of raw power it's right in line with the Snapdragon 865,0.42,621.843,352.89
Marques Brownlee,NE5H5intsck,Phone,Google,fine but just like I talked about in the problem with benchmarks video which you can watch here if you haven't seen it already Google is optimizing this tensor G2 chip to work more efficiently specifically with its AI stuff it's AI magic so while yeah the G2 is a little faster than the first tensor with its smaller four nanometer process node the real improvements are in its machine learning capabilities which are 60 faster and 20 percent more efficient than last year so the things that actually require those AI smarts are dramatically better and faster so that is where it starts to get interesting not to dismiss the you know slight improvements of the pixel overall I mean you can see they even they painted inside the port and the speakers down here to match the rails of the phone it's nice I like it but that's not what the pixel is all about the pixel is the software it is the smartest smartphone and pretty much all the reasons you'd pick a phone like a pixel 7 over the rest are in the software like for phone calls for example pixel is the only phone with call screening which to me is still super useful but it also goes to another level so when you call a business that has an automated system the improved direct my call feature will surface all the buttons at once so you can press to navigate through an automated system before the robot even finishes saying them it saves me so much time I love that I also like the new home screen search which still has all the great functionality as before it's just cleaner and better designed and then with the new selfie camera the pixel has added AI based Face Unlock which is great but as you can see it's just a single selfie camera up top here there's no infrared depth mapping or face ID equivalent so while it's super fast in great conditions it absolutely struggles as expected when you're in the dark or when you have a mask on so there's also still an under display fingerprint reader for dual biometric authentication anytime Face Unlock fails I will say I was hoping that the fingerprint reader would be one of the things that improved to the pixel 7 Hardware wise because the one in the six was a little bit of a letdown for me it's it's not noticeably bigger or faster it's fine it's not terrible it's just a slight step behind the ultrasonic ones which are noticeably faster than this Optical one oh also the recorder app most some people don't even care about this but the recorder app is better it's already the best in the world at doing incredibly fast and accurate speech to text you've seen this before thanks tensor but I got an amazing demo of somebody starting a recording and then putting the phone in their pocket and we had a full-on conversation they took the phone out of their pocket and it had perfectly transcribed our entire conversation with,176.64,621.843,312.83899999999994
Marques Brownlee,NE5H5intsck,Phone,Google,speaker labels so each time the opposite person spoke it labeled that incredibly useful or incredibly creepy depending on who you are but that's one of the features that's allegedly coming later this year to an update I'm going to be using that and it just definitely feels like anywhere you go on this phone Google assistant is waiting right around the corner waiting to help you out it was the same with the last pixel Android 13 got its improvements with material U and the under the hood improvements but just the Google stuff everywhere the routines the little reminders the little chip cards words and messages for helpful things you might want to do to add to a message there's a lot of good stuff there's even a new feature called photo unblur you might have seen the demos basically takes any photo in your pixel 7's Library actually anything in your Google photos library at all and if it's a little bit blurry you hit that unblur button and it can use AI to identify what the scene should look like and fix the photo remove the blur seems super cool so okay after trying this with a bunch of photos we found that it seems to work best specifically with photos of subjects that are in Focus but the exposure time was too long and so now there's a bit of blur in One Direction in that exact instance I found it can do a pretty good job of turning a streaky blurry photo into something much more usable I wouldn't expect anything magical but you know this is pretty cool it's the definition of using software to solve Hardware problems also if they do say pixel 7 exclusive for this feature for now I don't really buy it they say it's because of temps or G2 I give it about a year before this feature is available for more phones maybe anyone using Google photos but hey for now gotta have a pixel 7. but the point is Google is not setting out to make a phone with the absolute best hardware and the best display and the absolute best raw performance I mean if they are they're failing but Google pixel is absolutely the smartest smartphone in the room it's the smartest phone you can get and it's even more true again this year now the pixel has been known for one other thing probably as long as anything else and that's the cameras and there's an updated Suite of cameras on the front and the back of the pixel 7s this year so the 50 megapixel primary camera is the same on both same as last year the pro gets a new even wider Ultra wide with autofocus while the 7 keeps the one from last year and the pro also gets a new 5x 48 megapixel telephoto camera and as expected the pixel 7 and 7 Pro take X excellent photos in a variety of different lighting conditions and they have that very distinct pixel style the high dynamic range contrasty lots of detail those shots this big sensor can create some pretty nice natural depth of field still without using portrait mode,333.06,621.843,326.6399999999999
Marques Brownlee,NE5H5intsck,Phone,Google,I love that I know I shouldn't be super impressed that you know normal daylight photos look great on the pixel but hey these are really really good and then the new Pro Ultra wide does a really good job with macro photography doesn't do macro video but this photo of an ant is really hard to get and the auto switching to macro mode can be disabled if you're like me and prefer taking close-up photos of things with the main camera just be aware of minimum Focus distance but then here's another great example of solving Hardware problems with software the zoom so the One X camera still normal 1X that's a 50 megapixel main sensor binning down to 12 megapixels the 2x button is a 12 megapixel crop of the middle of the frame so a high quality Zoom then from 2x to 5 5x the camera is actually doing some composition it's adding detail in the middle of the frame from the telephoto camera and then compositing them together then you get to 5x and it's snapping to the full telephoto camera that makes perfect sense then again the 10x is taking a 12 megapixel crop of the middle of the telephoto so another high quality zoom and it's pretty good I will say it's not quite as good as having a dedicated 10x telephoto camera on the back of the phone like having a dedicated camera is always going to give you the sharper overall image but for someone like me who only zooms once in a while the whole super resume software solution is very passable as you can see and then that saves you money and then you get the zoom stabilization that activates at 15x and it is really really stable maybe a little too stable sometimes because it kind of makes it hard to track like moving objects which I know you love to do when you're creeping I mean bird watching anyway yeah the pixels camera right still top of the Heap when it comes to point and shoot Android cameras the shutter speed is super fast so if you're trying to freeze motion and also capture like an exact moment this camera is really good at that the selfie cameras on both are also improved it's now an 11 megapixel selfie camera they both do ultra wide selfies now instead of just the pro love that and video is slightly better too including 10-bit HDR tough to show that in this SDR video but if you've seen HDR video before you know where this excels already anything with bright specular highlights loads of dynamic range Etc it's still a step behind the iPhone when it comes to noise levels and autofocus so for those curious why I still put the iPhone as the overall king of smartphone imagery that's why but this is not far behind by any means okay here's a couple other small things that didn't fit into the rest of this review the speakers on the 7 Pro are slightly louder but slightly less Bassy than the 6 Pro just a little tinier so a little less low end for a little bit more vocal Clarity I found,496.8,621.843,332.641
Marques Brownlee,NE5H5intsck,Phone,Google,that interesting and then there's not a whole lot going for sustainability for these phones other than the metal visor and frame being made with 100 recycled materials some pretty specific wording there but also the box that comes in which doesn't have a charger does come with a cable and an adapter and is fully recyclable cardboard and then a big question are there bugs because my pixel 6 experience was a roller coaster I mean I I love the phone to start but then it's slowly descended into having more and more bugs until I it was like unusable to me and I stopped using it then it got some updates that squashed those bugs and then I ended up dailying it for like the last two months or so so all their bugs on the pixel 7s yeah I have found some I mean I had this media player bug where it just shows a blank space where the media player is supposed to be whether or not there was any media playing that did go away after reboot there was also this weird thing where after you hit the X in the Google search bar that button just disappears but it's still pressable for some reason also I tried to post the Instagram story from the pixel 7 Pro the other day and it just looked like this for some reason honestly no idea what happened here everyone saw it apparently some people thought it was an ad for dbrand's new digital camo it wasn't but this is hey if your new metal bar isn't enough and you want your new pixel to look even more different from the rest Channel sponsor dbrand's new skin is pretty sick and it's a foolproof way to make your phone look unique plus it hopes to hide that dust that sort of naturally accumulates right above and below the camera bar so link below of course right below that like button but I've really enjoyed using the pixel and that's why it's going in my pocket as my daily driver phone for now anyway as far as whether you should get one or not I think the real question is how much money are you willing to spend because same prices as last year 5.99 8.99 and I think my initial feeling is I still feel the same which some people got kind of Twisted by the way but the 300 difference between these phones the pixel 7 is a way better deal than the 7 Pro like they're both well priced and they're both very competitive and frankly undercutting most of what they're competing against but the seven is just for most people a no-brainer so uh this is the phone I'm gonna be recommending more often probably a value phone of the Year Contender again look there's a lot of stuff Google didn't do with the pixels like they didn't do super fast 80 watt charging they didn't do multiple telephoto cameras it doesn't even fold in half right there's a lot of stuff but for patient Pixel People Who prefer pristine programming and pretty pictures the pixel Pro is pretty perfect [Music],663.24,621.843,316.7579999999999
Marques Brownlee,CMtF7nxMv5A,Phone,Google,pixel has always been a leader in smartphone Innovation and we take it as a compliment when others in the industry follow our lead like the always-on display and at a glance introduced with pixel 2 and there's night sight which launched with pixel 3 and astrophotography and we introduced car crash detection three years ago pixel 7 pixel 7's Pro's front camera uses our Advanced machine learning models for face recognition to power face unlocked iPhone 10 your iPhone is locked until you look at it and it recognizes you we call this face ID we're introducing cinematic blur to the pixel camera in iPhone 13 brings a brand new feature cinematic mode starting at 2X super resume crops pixel 7 Pro's main 50 megapixel camera using a high resolution mode to provide a 12.5 megapixel 12 megapixels of the new sensor to deliver a full resolution photo and 4K video with Optical quality yeah I kind of just love how tech companies just throw subtle shots at each other on stage even though we all know at this point they're just copying each other in a giant Circle till we have the same features across everything anyway today was Google's event and we got our first look at Impressions and our Hands-On time with the Google pixel 7 and pixel 7 Pro and the pixel watch which is really interesting and we also got a preview of a really interesting look at the new pixel tablet so this video is everything you need to know about all that stuff so the phones there's a big phone and a small phone again the pixel 7 and the pixel 7 Pro they very much look like the pixel 6 now that it's an established recognizable visor identity but this time the visor is metal instead of glass and I don't love it but I also don't hate it like I guess I was one of the few people that really got to liking the glass visor but I will say this time it is one continuous piece of metal all the way around with no seam and that is better than before and it just feels really well built but you can also see the pixel 7 visor is matte while the pixel 7 Pro visor is glossy which I can already tell I'm gonna get this 7 Pro covered in fingerprints also I'm just going to say I miss accented color power buttons just throwing that out there anyway no other real design surprises here but then on the inside there is an updated set of specs so there they are you can pause this if you need to but basically the,3.38,621.843,293.78099999999995
Marques Brownlee,CMtF7nxMv5A,Phone,Google,bigger phone has a telephoto lens more RAM and a bigger battery and a bigger higher res ltpo display that's the deal but here's something I noticed I wasn't really mentioned even out loud during the keynote which is the pixel 7 display is flat again and you can see the cut out at the top for the new Ultra wide 11 megapixel selfie camera that they both share it's pretty sweet but the pixel 7 Pro display curves over the edges a bit less than before it's just a subtle curve now I'm really happy to see that but then as I mentioned in the last video which was about the iPhone 14 plus and benchmarks and how the big General Benchmark improvements are probably going to be pretty slight I was more interested just to see features just new interesting features that they enable on these new phones right and we got some and they range from kind of cool seen that already all the way to possibly incredible so yeah I'm going to keep my eye out on the overall performance of this next Generation tensor G2 chip efficiency smoothness all that but it also enables a few things a new cinematic video mode which basically appears to be doing the same thing Apple's new cinematic mode does which is track subjects and artificially blur backgrounds it also enables transcribed audio messages right in the Google messages app so if someone sends you a voice memo you don't have to find a place to listen to it you can just read it in text form and it makes night sight twice as fast it enables Face Unlock from just the new selfie camera and it should be able to do all this with 20 lower power consumption than the first tensor chip but the coolest feature to me easily is unblur is what it's called so so you have a picture that's slightly blurry you know maybe your hands were kind of shaky or it was slightly out of focus or you just had a slow shutter speed or something happened it's blurry it's soft normally you throw photo out but you don't have any other pictures of that moment and it was just too perfect and you kind of just want to save it or fix it so you can open that picture on the pixel 7 or 7 Pro and you hit that button and the tensor chip goes to work and it basically fixes the picture it uses AI it recognizes subjects and sharpens things up and it does a really good job you can see a before and after here of some of the pre-loaded photos I was trying at the event and they are genuinely impressive and the cherry on top is so you have to have a pixel 7 or,151.5,621.843,271.61999999999995
Marques Brownlee,CMtF7nxMv5A,Phone,Google,7 Pro to do this for now but you can do this with any picture in your entire Google photos Library any photo you've ever taken or even any photo you just save or have on your phone anything I can see people like remastering old Polaroids or like 30 year old yearbook photos just whatever else is in your library that you want to save seems pretty cool I'm going to be testing it for the full review to see how well it actually works with non-presupplied photos but I was impressed but then really mostly other changes that were interesting about these phones came in a camera department on the pro phone so there's a new ultrawide with autofocus just on the pro phone that is 21 wider and should be able to take some pretty decent macro photos now with these Focus pixels and there's a new 5x telephoto camera that's also huge 48 megapixels again and then they've worked a lot of software magic with making the in-between marks much more usable so for example the 2x button here will crop into the middle 12 megapixels of the main camera for a nice clean Zoom sound familiar but then the 10x does the same thing so the 10x Zoom is really just cropping into the middle 12 megapixels of the 5x telephoto camera so again hopefully a nice clean zoom and then a lot of super resume software magic and hopefully sharpening the photos of in between those numbers but there's also haptic stops in the camera UI to make it easy to hopefully hit those nice Clean Magic numbers and they also added a zoom preview thing for the furthest extremes of Zoom like Samsung did so now when you're taking those super creeper shots at like 30X it'll be nice and stable and easy to frame my biggest question is did they price these correctly because they went with the same prices as last year which is 5.99 for the small phone and 8.99 for the big one which okay it's the same I have a feeling 300 is going to feel like a big gap again like this is what we were saying last year for 300 extra dollars over the small phone you're getting bigger screen nicer battery and a telephoto camera and that's kind of it this year it feels like a tiny bit more it's screen battery and then like a whole Pro camera system with a better ultrawide and a better telephoto with lots of Zoom stuff but is that enough 300 I I don't know we'll see I just have a feeling that the the seven will feel,287.58,621.843,278.7
Marques Brownlee,CMtF7nxMv5A,Phone,Google,like a good deal and then a 7 Pro will feel like a tougher sell again but then we also finally got to see the Google pixel watch this is the thing that's been kind of hyped a lot I got to spend a little less time with it but I'm very interested in reviewing this particular watch so this might be a hot take but I think they did a b-plus job on the design I think it's really nice uh the full circle is great it's just one size which is pretty small and very lightweight there's three colors black silver and gold and definitely doesn't look like a computer on your wrist like some others can it can be a super inconspicuous little puck of a smart watch there's just two buttons the crown which can also scroll and then a button right above it and the way the watch bands connect to the watch is pretty neat it's a little bit finicky to me at first but I suspect it just takes some getting used to and the result is just this super seamless look with no lugs where it looks like the band just kind of pops out the top and the bottom of this circle now here's why I say B plus and not a plus bezels and battery so they curve the glass right over all the edges and kept the UI mostly black which is really thoughtful because most of the time especially in lower lighting it looks like it's basically a seamless display on your wrist most of the backgrounds are black most of the UI elements look like they're designed around sort of fading in and not overlapping the edges too much and even when they do overlap they have this nice little gradient even the flashlight app has a fade all the way around so you don't really think too hard about the bezel it's smart but if you catch the Light just right or maybe you're outside a lot then yeah you can see the bezel which is clearly not the smallest thing in the world okay fine but I'm actually a little bit more worried about battery life so they set on stage up to 24 hours of battery which you know knowing these companies is probably generous like that's probably maybe best case scenario without the always-on display maybe one workout and I mean this watch is truly tiny it's very Compact and light like there's just no way you can have a huge battery in it but I think it's a good idea to subscribe to be among the first to see the full review when it goes live and I get a chance to really test it functionality wise though it is very much a Fitbit Smart Watch like I think,426.6,621.843,268.9780000000001
Marques Brownlee,CMtF7nxMv5A,Phone,Google,it might be more of a Fitbit than a lot of people were expecting but you know smart watch wise it does all the normal stuff notifications custom watch faces Google pay with wallet Google Maps directions Google Assistant to set timers play some music Etc it's wear OS but then it's Fitbit for all the fitness stuff which there's plenty of so if you've used a Fitbit you already know about the workouts and mindfulness content and health metrics and sleep tracking and a sleep score and it has some really high frequency heart rate monitoring one reading every single second but other than the specifically the heart rate monitoring stuff it uses the Fitbit app for all that stuff so not Google Fit what happens to Google Fit unclear actually but the watch comes with six months of Fitbit premium for free and that you just interact with all this data just like it's a Fitbit so yeah it's a it's a Fitbit smart watch or it's a smart watch with Fitbit on top for all the fitness stuff so it's 349 for the Wi-Fi only and 400 for cellular so that means it's more expensive than the Apple watch SE it's more expensive than the Samsung Galaxy watch 5. interesting let me know which one of those smart watches you would consider for that money but lastly we did get a preview of the tablet another one but this time it did it was basically just one one really cool feature which is that it docks to a magnetic speaker dock and becomes basically a nest Hub Max and I think this is brilliant most tablets are just like around the house most of the time and Google knows this so they just built the ultimate house tablet I guess I do think though that this is a bit of a clue that this isn't going to be a super high-end like iPad Pro Galaxy Tab Pro super crazy premium like tablet this is this is definitely not competing with those like this thing will have a 10 inch screen single camera white bezels it's like this thing's designed for the 80 of tablets that just sit around the house and don't do too much like not the top few percent that are doing Peak Performance and productivity and media stuff I'm guessing and this is pure speculation and you can quote this I'm going to guess that this will be a 4.99 tablet like that's how I see this and then you'll buy the doc extra but we'll come back to this clip and see if I was right but yeah stay tuned for the reviews happy techtober thanks for watching this one and I'll catch you guys later peace [Music],562.019,621.843,322.8019999999999
Marques Brownlee,UsD87v8F914,Phone,Google,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and this is google's new budget phone the pixel 6a we knew this was coming i've had my hands on this phone for a little over a week now and i have my thoughts sort of summarized into one major thought which is there's a lot of competition in this budget phone space now and this phone isn't the obvious hands-down winner that it might have once been but this year more than ever i think the primary reason for that comes down to the display and i'll explain what i mean so what we're getting with this google budget phone is and this may sound familiar a new chip the exact same one that's in the flagship models the same software experience as the flagships but just with some cheaper hardware surrounding it you know kind of like the iphone se but google's version and so the price here is 449 dollars it really looks just like any other of the pixel 6 phones i mean that's the one thing i like about the whole lineup they're unmistakably pixel you've got the two-tone colors the camera bar across the middle is recognizable as a pixel from a mile away the only difference here is well it's a slightly new color this one is a sage green but also the camera bump isn't as tall so it's a bit slimmer it doesn't protrude out of the phone as much so i don't really use the ledge as a grip as much anymore as i used to on the other phones everything else though on the outside is pretty much the same it's got the aluminum rails same power and volume buttons on the right side with a notch between them the speakers and the slightly off center usb c port at the bottom it's all back on the inside though this phone is ip67 not ip68 and there is no wireless charging that to me was kind of a bummer i know we're probably saving a couple dollars here but this phone still has a glass,0.53,621.843,215.62899999999993
Marques Brownlee,UsD87v8F914,Phone,Google,back and i don't know if you've used wireless charging before then it's kind of worth noting that this one won't have it and then also the pixel 5a had a headphone jack this pixel 6a does not have a headphone jack so again if you use that then that's another thing to note but really around the front here is where the pixel 6a actually most reflects its price so we've got a 6.1 inch flat 1080p oled display at 60 hertz with a top center hole punch and an in-display fingerprint reader visually it's an okay display it's decently sharp with good color and it gets bright enough to support hdr and not totally suck outdoors but also it has some pretty serious off-axis rainbowing and the auto brightness is a little finicky and the fingerprint reader is definitely slow it's on the slow side just like it was on the pixel 6 and 6 pro now this may be forgivable stuff in a budget phone we've seen stuff like that around this price but what really takes it a tear down for me is the 60 hertz specifically because this one feels slow actually let me be more specific so this is a 60hz display there's lots of other 60hz displays in phones out there having a tensor chip which is a relatively high-end chip inside should mean that the phone still feels fast and it still opens apps pretty fast and that's still mostly true here but for whatever reason the responsiveness and the actual smoothness of the display this is not smooth so i think this is absolutely going to be one of those things that you either feel and notice right away or you just never notice i think there's a lot of people who are going to be looking to get a pixel 6a that are coming from an older phone coming from a budget phone coming from other 60 hertz phones and this will probably feel right in line but even amongst these 60 hertz phones i feel,110.159,621.843,226.16099999999997
Marques Brownlee,UsD87v8F914,Phone,Google,like this is one of the choppiest ones and now i've also recently come from a world of 120 hertz and 165hz flagship phones and gaming phones and that's not the normal place a 6a buyer will come from but the second you experience 120hz on a phone you are way more likely to notice the dropped frames in animations all the time even at 60hz literally just scrolling around pulling down the notification shade opening and closing apps normal stuff is just constantly slightly choppy now the funny thing is it's hard for me to show you this stuff on camera this is a 30 fps video and these things are happening somewhere between 30 and 60 fps but yeah this is one of those things where i bet if you get to see a 6a in a store or try it out then you'll feel what i'm talking about but it really is a feel thing and this is purely coming from my decade of phone testing experience this one feels choppy now depending on who you are even all of this might be acceptable knowing still that things are technically launching quickly and you're not lagging out and you're actually launching apps at normal speed but i'm combining all this with my knowledge of what i've just seen happen with the last year of pixels which is they haven't aged particularly gracefully so i've seen what happened to six and the six pro and i worry about how this fun will age considering how it feels now is guaranteed three years of software updates but what does this phone look like in three years now the good thing is everything else about the pixel here is exactly what you'd expect the same software experience as the big brothers with material u google's widgets and dynamic colors and stock apps like the calculator and settings and camera et cetera google's smartest features are all here like assistant call screening is awesome live translate and the sorcery that is basically instant speech to text everywhere in this phone thanks to the tensor chip they're all so good the haptics are also pretty good which,222.4,621.843,239.75999999999993
Marques Brownlee,UsD87v8F914,Phone,Google,is great to see in a budget phone along with the stereo speakers here really the only variables that could have come up as a surprise potentially would be battery or cameras so pixel 6a's battery is about 4 400 milliamp hours and it turned out to be fine there were some concerns because oh it's a tensor chip it's a higher end chip uses more power maybe in a smaller phone that's bad but turns out 60 hertz kind of balances that out so i had pretty good battery life i was just mildly annoyed by not having wireless charging but then there's the cameras so with the camera unlike the previous pixels this does not share the same cameras as the more expensive brothers the 6 and the 6 pro instead it has a downgraded 12 megapixel camera setup for both the standard and the ultra wide which might look disappointing on paper but this is the old sony imx 363 sensor which some of you nerds will already recognize is the same exact sensor that was in the pixel 5 and the same that was in the pixel 4 and the pixel 3 and the pixel 2 in other words this is an older smaller low resolution sensor but it is also absolutely a tried-and-true great smartphone camera because of google's computational photography chops so i really appreciated that even with the lower number you know with the tensor chip processing things happening really fast the shots that come out of this camera are crisp contrasty and confident just like they were with the older pixels the colors are on point too not too much over processing happening and there is not too much fringing at the edges either with close-up subjects and the dynamic range and how it handles highlights is a plus so i mean it's easy to see why they stuck with this for so long and the fact is this is still easily a top two budget smartphone camera easy it also has the ultra wide that the iphone se doesn't have and it takes decent looking 4k videos up to 60fps these cameras are like pizza sure,342.72,621.843,233.27900000000002
Marques Brownlee,UsD87v8F914,Phone,Google,they're not super new and groundbreaking there's nothing that would impress you about them on paper but they get the job done in a design that you can dress up like a ninja turtle if you get the right dbrand skins you know the ones linked in the description the conversation around the pixel 6a is probably the most interesting when you consider the competitors just the other phones that you could get for 450 and there's some other really good ones so to make it easy i think you should get the pixel 6a if you value the google software experience those features and or the camera way over everything else but if that's not you you could get a samsung galaxy a53 for a hundred bucks less and that's going to have 120hz display that has expandable storage or you could get a nothing phone which i just reviewed which has all those quirky lights features on the back but that's also got a much bigger much much smoother 120hz display and all their features you could even get an iphone se if you wanted to which yes is gonna be a 60 hertz single camera setup with a smaller battery but that's also a flagship chipset that's also wireless charging and that's also let's be real it's an iphone which is enough of a feature for some people and then there's some nord phones and some pocophones and some moto g's all with their own merits so yeah pixel 6a turns out is really all about the google software experience and the camera for the price that's where it excels but yeah if you're shopping around keep your eyes open because there's a bunch of good stuff and while good phones aren't getting cheap cheap phones are still very much getting good there you have it that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],459.199,621.843,217.828
Marques Brownlee,U3DNz5asasA,Phone,Google,all right what's up mkbhd here and today was google's i o their annual developer conference and usually we don't see a ton of hardware at events like this but this one for whatever reason we got a ton of hardware or at least hardware announcements so there's kind of three levels of announcements going on here so first of all there's the right around the corner coming up next stuff that's two things and they're going to be going on sale in the next month or so then there's the later this year section so we did get a bit of a sneak preview at some more fall hardware some stuff that we're actually going to get fully unveiled later this year and then there's the on the horizon section which is they went ahead and pre-announced a piece of 2023 hardware for some reason but we'll get to that but first of all in the next up section pixel 6a and pixel buds pro these are both things that we kind of knew were coming but now we're finally getting all the details of these announcements so for the pixel 6a it is essentially a slightly smaller slightly bumped down pixel six and it will retail for 449. so honestly from what we can tell here the 6a will be very similar to the pixel 6. you can see the design same camera bar same glass same software with all the material you and live captions and speech recognition and camera features and it's powered by the same exact tensor chip from the flagship pixel six and six pro but you know those phones are going on past six months old now so you can imagine the price of manufacturing some of those parts is starting to go down but the real main difference between the pixel 6a and the pixel 6 which is 599 is the display and cameras which is really interesting so for the display it is smaller a little bit the more premium pixels are both pretty big this will have a 6.1 inch 1080p 60 hertz g-o-led display which is still big but it's now the smallest pixel so then cameras are the other interesting thing so now google telling us that cameras are one of the areas where they saved cost from the pixel 6 means that yeah okay this a is going to have cheaper cameras than the pixel 6 which worried me at first so it is still a standard and an ultra wide and you can kind of see a slightly new visual design in the camera bar which i'll touch on more in a second but on the spec sheet it actually tells us it is the sony imx,2.32,621.843,286.4
Marques Brownlee,U3DNz5asasA,Phone,Google,363 that's the sensor for the main camera which is actually the same 12 megapixel sensor that we've seen in some of those older pixels pixel 4 pixel 3 pixel 2 this is a tried and true older sensor so cheaper yes but also probably not bad but other things like materials and battery appear to be about the same although do definitely have to test that stuff i i would suggest getting subscribed to see that review video when it comes out here battery could be an interesting one because this is the smallest lowest refresh rate display in any pixel but it still has the same tensor chip so we'll see how that gets handled could be amazing but the other specs i can confirm are six gigs of ram and 128 gigs of storage ip67 water resistance it does have an in display fingerprint reader there's a 4400 milliamp hour battery with 18 watt charging but there is no mention of wireless charging and then sub 6 5g and millimeter wave 5g with specific models and five years of android security updates so that's the pixel 6a and that's the new budget smartphone but it's launching alongside a new high-end set of earbuds from google pixel buds pro so if we have pixel buds a series i looked on google store that's actually the only one they're selling right now so the a series for 100 bucks is like regular airpods basically and then pixel buds pro for 200 bucks would be sort of equivalent to airpods pro so this is a 199 dollar noise canceling pair of wireless earbuds they do have a transparency mode they'll have multi-device connectivity compatible with android ios and computers google assistants built-in they have ipx4 sweat resistance and overall the design i'm going to say it looks pretty tame you know you can see the mics each earbud has three microphones you got the silicon tips in front of an 11 millimeter driver and the case looks basically the same as the original pixel buds with the black and white design and the magnet and wireless charging the quoted battery life is 11 hours of listening or seven hours with active noise cancellation turned on basically i feel like the differentiating factor with these especially when we get them and listen to how they sound is gonna come from the six core audio chip on board which also apparently will have a lot to do with the noise cancellation the transparency mode and just overall the way they sound now i've been waiting a long time for a,145.44,621.843,281.67800000000005
Marques Brownlee,U3DNz5asasA,Phone,Google,pair of earbuds with noise cancellation and a transparency mode that rivals airpods airpods still to this day have far and away the best transparency mode i've ever heard in any pair of headphones so i'm looking forward to maybe pixel buds stepping their game up in that dimension it's just one part of headphones um but yeah the competition has a lot of other things going for them so we'll see how the pixel buds stack up but yeah that's what's up next that's the stuff that'll be on sale this summer but then google went ahead and gave us a little bit of a preview of some stuff that's coming up this fall including a full design reveal of the pixel 7 and 7 pro and a new pixel watch finally so this is our limited first look at the pixel 7 and 7 pro so the details of course are way more confined with this stuff but you can see the new colors here and you can also see a bit more of that camera design and super bold big camera circles and the camera bar and an extra detail is we also know that that glass is soft touch which i am very excited about so they've sort of gone back and forth on soft touch but if you remember the pixel threes with the soft touch glass i remember i really liked that back of a phone finish if it's anything like that i'm very excited about it and seeing as there is a black 7 pro at the bottom i'm thinking that's probably going to end up being the one i prefer although matt white typically does a great job hiding fingerprints so we'll see this phone will have the next generation tensor chip and it will launch with android 13 but that's pretty much all we know at this point so yeah new phone coming out this fall pixel 7 and 7 pro new chip new colors new matte finish and then yeah i guess we can also technically see it still has a port at the bottom and it definitely has speakers all the classic stuff some new colors i'm not sure how i feel about this gray with the green undertone but it does contrast well with the gold but probably the more interesting preview we got is the one of the new pixel watch they're finally doing it this fall we're going to have i mean theoretically maybe a competitor to the apple watch but sort of in the android world i've been waiting for this for a long time it's a sort of a result of their collaboration or i guess purchase of fitbit and this is it this is the pixel watch so okay it's a circular stainless steel,286.479,621.843,291.921
Marques Brownlee,U3DNz5asasA,Phone,Google,design and it is a very simple silhouette as you can see not a whole lot to set it apart on the outside but i do like that it is simple and it has what they're calling a tactile crown for input though it's also a touch screen and it has interchangeable bands and it runs wear os this is the pixel watch that we've been i mean hearing so much about for so long and waiting for it's clearly got some solid bezels all the way around i mean that's the first thing i notice when the screen is on and i guess i'm judging just by eyeballing these lifestyle photos but it looks like it's about the same size as the smaller apple watch i'm thinking maybe around 40 millimeters there isn't any mention of two different sizes like a small and a large i think it would make sense but they didn't say but basically that's all we really know know about the new pixel watch again this is something that we're gonna get way more details on when it actually does get fully unveiled in october whenever their event is but there are a bunch of things that i'm also hoping for like i'm hoping it has a bright efficient crispy oled display you know this ui they're showing has a lot of black and the black bezel clearly goes all the way around so i'm hoping that it's an oled so it can sort of seamlessly blend into the bezel instead of being really obvious and ugly like a cheaper lcd i'm also of course hoping for good battery life at least a full day and if it's going to be a premium price i'm also hoping it has things like good haptics and good performance these animations of the ui showing smart home controls and checking notifications like it's cool but again i definitely want to play with it myself one thing to note though is this is basically going to act like a fitbit like it seems like most of the the fitness tracking and sleep tracking and stuff like that you need the fitbit app to work for so it's going to act just like a fitbit in that way and then wear os is going to work the way you typically expect it to paired with an android phone and then they've said there will be a cellular option so the watch can work without the phone and it'll do activity and sleep tracking and stuff like that through fitbit and also it appears this will just be working specifically with android phones probably best with the pixel but with android phones and not the iphone because in classic apple fashion lots of the stuff that the apple,432.56,621.843,265.361
Marques Brownlee,U3DNz5asasA,Phone,Google,watch can do no other smartwatch has access to so this this is very much an android smartwatch so yeah stay tuned for more details on that later but yeah then last but not least this was the announcement we got basically zero information on but google did officially say that they're going to be dropping a pixel tablet in 2023 that's what they've told us that's kind of all we know like we don't know any of the specs we don't know what time of year it'll come out we don't know what it'll even really be called technically we do know it will be on the larger side and on the premium side so i'm thinking like ipad air to ipad pro type price range and equivalent but it feels like they're not really committing to anything else yet as far as a tablet goes i guess visually basically we just have this shot of the pixel portfolio where we can see that there is a tablet and it'll definitely have a camera and speakers and presumably a screen on the other side but yeah that's it it's really interesting that they're deciding to show off some of this stuff so early it kind of reminds me on one hand of sony who will announce a phone early in the year and then six months later it'll finally come out and all the hype is gone and everybody forgot about it but on the other hand this is google we're talking about and they've always been leaking things constantly i mean they try to get ahead of the leaks this feels like them just going hey you know what instead of the phone leaking for the next six months we'll just tell people about it and take advantage of that because otherwise you just lose the hype and your own messaging so yeah let me know what you think is the most exciting or what you're looking forward to the most of this new google stuff i'm definitely interested in in the watch actually i want to see what that's like on the wrist and to actually use but let me know in the comments section below we'll talk about it but yeah that's been it thanks for watching also random shout out but the ipod was officially discontinued this week probably one of the products everyone watching this video has at some point owned some version of so rip press f and in the chat to pay respects all right catch you guys the next one peace,565.6,621.843,253.27800000000002
Marques Brownlee,9hvjBi4PKWA,Phone,Google,[Music] so [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and i've been using pixel 6 and pixel 6 pro for about three weeks now this is it this is the first year we're expecting a real google flagship right so previous pixels have been pretty nice and they've had great cameras and pretty cool software features but overall pretty lackluster hardware but this is a step up we're expecting big things a big new camera array a new design language they made their own chip there's a lot going for it so this is their moon shot right this is their chance to compete with the big dogs so now that i've used them i will say these are my favorite pixels ever and they are the most google phones ever made for sure but reality check they're not perfect and there's definitely some areas where they come up a little bit short so i'm going to go over those things but off the top i just want to hit you with the prices first okay so 5.99 for pixel 6 starting and 8.99 for the pixel 6 pro those are both at 128 gigs that's really competitive so there's a lot of action already at that like 599 dollar price range but also the one they keep calling a flagship which is the six pro this is the one that's here to take shots at the iphones and samsung galaxy s21 ultras of the world and it competes but the six is the real deal so i've grown to really like this camera bar design for the pixels and the fact is it is polarizing like it doesn't look quite like any other phone theoretically you know the huge new camera sensors need all this thickness here but it could have looked like any other phone like the vivo x70 pro plus has the same 50 megapixel sensor but they went with a camera rectangle but this visor it's a look this is the uh the pixel phone look now it's very easily recognizable and i think that's on purpose and they can keep it this way for at least a few years and the bar design is functional i will say my index finger does end up resting nicely underneath the camera bar when i'm holding it which is nice it doesn't rock on a table either if you're typing or using it out of your hand the only weird part is it doesn't quite like blend nicely into the aluminum sides of this phone like i think it would have been really cool if it was like a seamless blend like one piece like what samsung did with the s21 ultra but there are a lot of seams all over this camera module but hey at the end of the day if you're just going to toss the case on it like this grip case from channel sponsor dbrand it's basically just going to cancel the bump anyway but now you've got you know a flat even phone you've got your icons logos but it's still obviously a pixel underneath that you still have the visor across the back so i think it's a win unless you think it's incredibly ugly in which case try not to look at the back of the phone too much but come on visors look cool but the part you look at on the front of the phone is huge on both screens both of these phones are huge and i think the the question naturally is why didn't they make a smaller one and i think google's answer would be well there are people who want to spend less on a phone but most of those people still want a big screen so they gave it to him so pixel 6's screen is a pretty massive 6.4 inches from corner to corner 90 hertz 1080p and flat and with pretty small bezels overall and a hole punch in the top middle for the selfie camera it's a pretty good screen again for a 600 phone but how about that flagship though so with the 6 pro we're looking at 6.7 inches 1440p and up to 120 hertz it is super super sharp very responsive and has been an absolute pleasure but since they're saying it's the flagship i can get a little more nitpicky here these curved edges they're kind of going out of style i know that gets you even smaller bezels and they are a little bit smaller but the fact that it gets kind of a bit darker in the very corners isn't doing the screen any favors and there also is a little bit of color shift off axis that you really straight up just don't see on the more expensive screens like on the s21 ultra or the iphone 13 pro also the fingerprint reader on the display of both of these phones is kind of slow so it appears to be an optical sensor shining a light on your finger instead of those new ultrasonic ones samsung is using and yeah it's gotten kind of annoying after a while often it will take a full like half second at least long enough for me to get annoyed that i'm waiting for it to read my finger i think they,2.05,621.843,533.7469999999998
Marques Brownlee,9hvjBi4PKWA,Phone,Google,could have used a better sensor here or at least done this a little faster i am comparing it to thousand dollar phones though so again this is what i was talking about earlier it's impressive that it's hanging with the big dogs but it is just undercutting it a little bit now the top hole punch in the middle of these displays houses the selfie camera it's a pretty decent 8 megapixel wide camera on the pixel 6 but it's closer to an ultra wide selfie on the 6 pro which i really like a lot and it's also bumped up to 11 megapixels so it can also shoot 4k selfie video fits more people on the frame big fan of the six pros selfie camera and then also you know the little things that you'd sort of expect a great phone to do well but that you don't want to have to think about too much like clicky buttons check both phones are fully water resistant and the haptics are really good on both phones as well so that's a pixel thing but the biggest new piece google's adding to these phones is definitely on the inside and that would be the new tensor chip so designed by google for this phone this is going to let them do in theory things that they couldn't do with the off-the-shelf qualcomm chip they'd used before you know machine learning better ai better computational photography all kinds of things they want to focus on with just this phone they can do it and it's done that it's really impressive now a lot of people are wondering how tensor would benchmark just and i don't think that's the right way to think about this new chip but just out of curiosity i threw a geekbench at it and we have the numbers it got 1035 on single core 2800 multi-core so that's maybe 8 to 10 slower with the cpu on paper than the snapdragon triple eight but also still way way ahead of the snapdragon 765 g they used on the pixel five last year but then also i did uh some gpu benchmarks from 3dmark and it was looking at 10 to 12 faster than the snapdragon triple a but that's clearly not what tensor is about this this might be the biggest this is what makes it a googly phone this is the biggest difference between the benchmarks and what the phone is actually capable of that i've ever seen so first of all these phones have been really quick and responsive no performance problems for me i've mostly been dailying the 6 pro which has got the adaptive refresh rate up to 120 hertz and i've been loving that but it's not about the performance as much as it's about the features and this continues a tradition of the pixel phone being the smartest smartphone to come out every year so you know besides the stuff we've already seen like call screening where google assistants can filter incoming calls for you or now playing which ambiently detects whatever song is playing in the background in your environment and just keeps a running list so you can remember what song was going on in the background in the grocery store an hour ago and we've seen live captioning of any and all videos and phone calls and movies in real time besides all of that there is some new improved stuff thanks to tensor and dedicated pieces of that ship so first of all speech to text unreal on this phone absolutely incredible to the point where it actually changes the way i use the phone i try to use voice more often on this phone because it's so good so anywhere i'd normally be typing i use that mic button anywhere i can and no matter how fast you talk you can basically rap at it you can talk 200 words per minute like eminem if you want to and it'll just keep going quick it also adds punctuation really accurately so you don't really even have to think about that you're just automatically grammatically accurate all the time this is going to make sitting in lectures and people in class taking notes way less stressed and basically anywhere else transcription is useful and even on top of all that it's smart so if you say a name it will pull from the names in your contacts try to make sure it spells it right if there's multiple different spellings of names for something and you correct it once it will remember that corrected spelling of a name things like that if you say delete this or send it doesn't type those words it knows what you're trying to do and will actually delete the words or send the message now there's also a new feature in google photos for pixel six that lets you go back to any picture in your library and erase the things that you don't want now this isn't blowing your mind if you've seen content aware phil on photoshop before but i'm mostly really impressed with how easy and simple it makes the process so you go into any image go to tools and it's called magic eraser and it automatically,274.639,621.843,506.4810000000001
Marques Brownlee,9hvjBi4PKWA,Phone,Google,selects what it thinks you want to remove usually a background photo bomber of some sort and then you can just do it and if there's other stuff you want to remove you can draw a sloppy outline around it it will auto detect the edges usually really well with any sort of contrast finds the object you're talking about and just removes it just like that so it kind of reads like magic and people on twitter loved it but just like photoshop's content aware feel it has certain things it works really well on and other things not so much so it works best with simple repeating backgrounds you know maybe gradients or textures and with a lot of contrast but if you try to get rid of like a large object that's in front of several different backgrounds well that's just gonna look bad like that's difficult for ai but i was very impressed with some of the things that pulled off just messing around with it it's probably a gimmick feature still for most people but this is yet another demo of the powerful ai and tensor that can be pretty great sometimes now something i thought would be better with tensor is battery life and you know maybe i was getting my hopes up too high because what i saw apple do with their silicon has been amazing like their chips are basically the pinnacle of efficiency not to compare too much but when i see iphone 13 pro max getting eight plus hours of screen on time easy with a 4300 milliamp hour battery that's pretty amazing so now i see pixel 6 come out 40 600 milliamp hour battery in the pixel 6 and 5 000 milliamp hours in the 6 pro and they design their own chips so i was thinking this would be amazing it's not so i was consistently getting three and a half to four and a half hours of screen on time on the pixel 6 pro and slightly less on the six which is just average at best it's not that great like that's dead by the end of a long day pretty often now on a 600 phone that's not too crazy you can probably forgive that but on a flagship that's a weakness and then also on top of that you got to remember there is no charging brick in the box like we saw and it supports up to 30 watts of wired charging which is not super fast but it's it's okay and the wireless charging that's supported is even a little bit slower than that so the battery situation for me has been overall kind of a bummer on the flagship i can get around it by just charging all the time like in my car at my desk at work but you never really want to have to do that you kind of just want to be able to use your phone normally and not think about it but hey using this phone when it's not running low on battery has been awesome thanks to android 12. i want to use it all the time totally made over aesthetic material you and all kinds of visual overhaul happening here so i made an entire video about all the new features here which i'll link below that like button but yeah i really like most of it at first it definitely feels like a little spread out like there's a lot of extra blank and like white space in the ui there's these huge ui elements and really big buttons and especially on a huge phone with a huge screen it feels kind of cartoonish at first but it all comes together it's sort of this big flowing bouncy ui with matching colors and lots of nice scrolling physics and haptics it all ties together but yeah it's just nice that no matter what wallpaper i choose for example the quick settings and the settings app and all the menu backgrounds and widgets all find an accent color in the wallpaper and match it right away it's just it's so sweet it's nice it's nice my only little gripe with android 12 is two things actually one that the brightness slider is two swipes away it's all the way at the top and you got to drag it down i i just think that could be way more reachable and way more accessible and the other thing is i don't like the new internet toggle i usually just want to turn wi-fi on or off but now that takes an extra tap and i feel like they could just add a wi-fi toggle in the quick settings but just a general internet one exists but you know what when you think about pixel what do you think of you think of the software and the camera i think the software is pretty great so let's talk about the most distinctive part of this phone the camera so pixels have had the same camera more or less since the pixel 2 right this small 12 megapixel sensor on the pixel 2 was pretty revolutionary for its time and so they kept the same one in pixel 3. and then kept the same one in pixel four and then kept the same one in pixel five and it was fine because others were catching up around them with better,527.839,621.843,532.0010000000002
Marques Brownlee,9hvjBi4PKWA,Phone,Google,hardware but google had figured out a really great way to compensate for the small sensor with incredible software amazing computational photography great hdr and multi-frame bracketing and all this stuff that made their images their night sight all of those photos look incredible it was almost like they just proved with these cameras that the software is more important than the hardware itself but now here we are in 2021 everyone's catching up and so now pixel 6 has launched with a brand new camera system featuring a much better hardware suite a huge 50 megapixel main sensor but you can't actually take 50 megapixel photos there's no high res mode or anything for it it's always binning and everything is down to 12 and a half megapixels and then there's a new 12 megapixel ultra wide and the pro phone also gets a 4x telephoto camera as well so okay been shooting with it i think google's still running all of their camera algorithms at 11 like when they don't need to anymore so this has much better hardware and they had been compensating like i said for a smaller weaker sensor to bring it up and bring out all the magic and now running that same type of look starts to make photos look a bit over processed a little over hdr-y pretty frequently so there are a bunch of interesting things about this camera but like i said 50 megapixels doing 4-1 binning with no option to keep all 50 means you're only really getting a small amount of improved sharpness over the previous but photos are sharp white balance is pretty good but still bias is a little bit too cool sometimes but you can see in regular lighting the pixel does an enormous amount of hdr and it almost looks like someone turned up the clarity slider in photoshop just a little bit too high so shadows never quite get all the way to black and it's very rare that highlights like the sky are ever blown out but then yeah that also gives you a bit of an exaggerated like over-processed look when the photo should just have regular lighting now the thing is this sensor is amazing so it's taking in a ton of light and a lot of information so actually the more difficult high dynamic range shooting situations are handled great like shooting directly into the sun or shooting at night with bright lights these more difficult shots are actually very impressive looking now because the processing is keeping so much information in the final shot but even so these darker scenes tend to overexpose when you don't adjust the slider in the viewfinder so it's really impressive believe me having all this sharpness and almost no noise in a nighttime shot that's technically incredible but it shouldn't look this bright so here's a comparison shot with the iphone 13 pro on full auto just to give you an idea of the difference between night modes it's almost turning night into day on the pixel but here's a pretty perfect example to visualize all this processing on the left is a raw shot from the pixels camera that we colored with just a quick boost to the vibrance and on the right side is a google process jpeg and that sensor you can see is getting a ton of information and detail and the processing is to make it look like what it thinks we want on a phone screen again bringing up the shadows bringing down the highlights sharpening everything but i think the ideal might be somewhere in between these now the ultrawide is pretty good it's not amazing but it has a lot of the same traits as last year and i'm glad they're still in ultra wide there's no macro mode with it though and then the telephoto on the pro was surprisingly good when you're moving around handheld although you still get much better sharpness out of like an s21 ultra google super resume is pretty good at sharpening up and improving shots that would normally be soft but they can still tend to look a little bit like a watercolor painting at the extremes but overall you know as someone who's loved the pixel's rich contrast look and really honestly preferred it for years over pretty much anything else i think this is an almost great camera that can take some tweaks and and maybe some software updates at least i'm hoping to get better because i i've taken some incredible sharp photos with this camera and i've also taken some weird looking ones so basically i guess the question is would you rather have a camera that's a 10 out of 10 sometimes but also a 7 out of 10 some other times or just a camera that just gives you 9 out of 10 9 9 nine every single time because that's the iphone that nine out of ten that consistent shot the iphone 13 pro's camera system is more,793.36,621.843,530.639
Marques Brownlee,9hvjBi4PKWA,Phone,Google,consistent but the pixels camera aces some shots sometimes but then also gives me a really weird over hdr looking shot that i wouldn't even want to share so bounces back and forth i will say the video from the pixel did really level up kind of the same style as the photos it has great dynamic range great stabilization and that big sensor is giving you real background blur and impressively staying in focus most of the time and in some of these harder scenes you can definitely see the processing working like here when it's trying to bring up the shadows it's pretty noisy but still overall color and exposure and white balance and the details are all great with the pixel 6's video and i'm really happy to see that and then another thing i noticed the pixel really cranks iso all the way up in the viewfinder so you can see a lot of noise before you snap a photo and start the processing like it's very easy to see this here in a screen recording but that's what it's doing you can see in a selfie viewfinder especially it'll look super jacked up and really noisy just to keep a high frame rate and shutter speed when you're taking the selfie and then you take it and you see it process and then everything sharpens up and it looks miles better and while that seemed kind of weird to me at first i actually think this is a good move so tensor has a horsepower to just run the stuff at high iso and the preview might not look great but at least it's not choppy and laggy and then it basically under promises and over delivers people will see the viewfinder and think this will be a bad photo and then they'll be shocked at how good the final photo is when you're taking photos with faces in them the ultrawide camera is always running at a higher shutter speed so if you get someone moving too quick and the primary camera has a blurry face it can merge in the faster sharper face from the ultrawide camera into your shot automatically i mean that's you kind of just never have blurry faces in your photos overall just as someone who's used now both of these phones for a couple weeks iphone's camera system is better than the pixels it just is right now it doesn't it's more consistent it doesn't struggle with over processing it shoots to more formats it's a better overall camera system but this the hardware is so good in the pixels and you can see that promise in those 10 out of 10 shots that the pixel fan in me is like hoping maybe in one or two software updates it'll be a 10 out of 10 more often but until then because we don't know if that's ever gonna happen yeah you saw the sample shots that's that's what it does that's how it looks so yeah i want to come back to the price at the end here like i said 5.99 for pixel 6 8.99 for pixel 6 pro it's a 300 delta and for that difference you're getting 120 hertz over 90 1440p over 1080 a curved screen over a flat one some glossy sides over the matte sides i like the matte sides better then you get an extra telephoto camera on the back and you get a wider selfie camera on the front a little more ram a little bit bigger screen that's kind of it so basically my conclusion is pixel 6 really good phone really really great deal because for 600 bucks this is one of the best ones you can get and then the difference in money to get to six pro it makes it a better phone than the pixel six sure a lot of good stuff here but this stuff doesn't vault it over the top of all the other flagships it just you know i would get this phone if you've really got to have the telephoto or the ultra wide selfie camera or the bigger faster screen that's kind of the main bullets but i think pixel 6 is almost incredible and the truth is this is the most important google phone yet this this pivot to you know from enthusiast phones and really cool cameras and software features to still being the smartest smartphone in the world but also now having much better hardware this new design and making their own chip and competing like really competing i'm into it i'm super into it so that's fun to see that's pixel six and six pro it's techtober so there's still a lot more to talk about so stay tuned for that stuff subscribe if you haven't already thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music],1059.039,621.843,501.879
Marques Brownlee,roWxo6jWoYw,Phone,Google,"(upbeat music) - Hey, what's up, MKBHD here. And we finally have them, two of maybe the most hyped devices of the entire year in their real retail boxes, the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro. And right off the bat, you can see these new, smaller boxes, which you already know what that means, but let's just get started with the Pixel 6 here, the smaller one. So we've got these little plastic tabs on the sides of this recycled cardboard box. You get past those, flip it over, and right up at the top, there you have it. This is the Kinda Coral Pixel 6, looking exactly how we've seen it in all these materials and on websites and in teasers for the past six months or however long it's been, this is it. Flat display up front, camera visor on the back, with two different tones, two different color oranges on this design, but with the rest of the box, as you can see, if we get into that, you get a USB type C cable and you have a USB A adapter along with some paperwork, and there is a sim card removal tool over here also. But yeah, as you can tell, there is no charging brick in the box, but now we know. This phone will start at 599 for 128 Gigs. Now I've got a lot of thoughts on this, but hang on to that for a quick second, let's take a look at also the slightly larger phone in the slightly larger box. Again, with tabs on the back, and I kind of like this. We're not really needing to use a knife as often anymore with unboxings, but then again, up top here, we have the Stormy Black Pixel 6 Pro looking like an evolved Nexus 6P, for those of you who remember that phone, shout out to you. And if you look closely, you can also see, it is actually, technically, also dual tone, the top gray is a little bit lighter than the bottom gray, but this phone, this phone will also start at 128 Gigs of storage",0.198,621.843,104.01800000000001
Marques Brownlee,roWxo6jWoYw,Phone,Google,"and it's at 899. So 599 and 899 for these two phones. My reaction when I first saw these prices was like, ""Oh wow, that's a lot better than I expected."" A 599 for the Pixel 6, that just feels like a really good deal. That was just my gut, but then my second thought was, ""Okay, now there is $300 in difference in price between these two phones. And there's not a whole ton of difference between them, physically."" It kind of makes the 6 Pro seem like maybe a little bit of a tough sell, but anyway, for this video, I'm not allowed to share any new software features or any sample photos yet, or really anything conclusive yet until my full review, which is pretty annoying, and quite frankly, a bit of a red flag, but for this video, what I can show you, for those considering pre-ordering, is everything that is now real about these phones and confirmed and all the differences between them and my reactions to that. So these phones both have similar specs, both have the new Tensor Chip we've talked so much about and the new Titan M2 security chip, they both start at 128 Gigs of storage, although the 6 Pro can go up to half a Terabyte while the smaller 6 goes up to 256 and the 6 Pro does have more ram. It has 12 Gigs of ram, while there's eight Gigs in the smaller phone, but really the biggest difference between them is the size and that screen on the front. And it's not even that huge of a difference. They're both pretty huge, but you can see here, Pixel 6 has a 6.4 inch flat, 90 hertz, 1080P OLED display, like I said, already a pretty big screen, but then the 6 Pro has a 6.7 inch, 120 Hertz, 1440P LTPO display that's slightly curved around the edges. So this one can modulate up and down from as little as 10 hertz all the way up to 120.",108.4,621.843,111.13299999999998
Marques Brownlee,roWxo6jWoYw,Phone,Google,"That's the benefit of that LTPO technology. And it also has a slightly smaller chin and some smaller side bezels, too. Some people may prefer this. It does look a bit more premium. Either way, these are the biggest Pixels ever, and they do now much more resemble the higher end phones out there. You know, they've got the whole punch camera up top for the selfies and the fingerprint reader underneath the glass on the lower third, but then a slightly bigger phone also does mean slightly more room on the inside to take advantage of, which means the bigger one does have more room inside for a bigger battery, 4600 million powers on the Pixel 6, 5,000 million powers on the 6 Pro, so those are both pretty good numbers on paper and the bigger one also does get an extra camera inside. So in this camera visor, that's what I'm calling it, they share this new 50 megapixel larger primary camera and the same ultra-wide, but the 6 Pro also has a folded 4x optical zoom lens for those telephoto shots. I am very interested in testing this whole new camera system now that they've finally, finally, upgraded so much of this hardware and there's some big promises made about both photos and videos that could be really cool, but again, not allowed to show that yet so we'll just have to wait and see, definitely get subscribed so you do see that early. But also the last little thing, the difference is just the rails on the side of the phone. On the Pixel 6, it's matte black and they're made of aluminum, while the Pixel 6 Pro has a slightly heavier, technically, more durable glossy stainless steel. It is pretty dark stainless steel though, not like the lighter colors on the Pro iPhones that show a lot of fingerprints, but all that being said, I honestly think I prefer the look and feel of the Pixel 6 overall. And that's as someone who doesn't plan on putting a case on this phone. You know, usually, there's a difference between seeing a render of a phone,",220.91,621.843,104.65
Marques Brownlee,roWxo6jWoYw,Phone,Google,"like an image on some website on a screen or something, and then actually getting out the box and holding it and looking at it. And usually, I like it more once I hold it in real life. And this is another one of those designs that looks kind of strange, at least very unique, on paper or on your screen, and then once you start using it, pretty quickly, you get used to it. But I think their goal with this phone is to look unique, like to not look like any other phone. We've all seen the rounded camera bump in the corner of the phone. And if their goal was to stand out and not do that, and really establish like a Pixel design, I think they've done that. And the funny thing is, once you start using a phone with this like full width visor, is what I'm calling it, it actually, first of all, acts as a place to rest your finger if you hold the phone like this, the way I do. And also it won't rock nearly as much, actually, it won't rock at all back and forth on a table, so that's a nice bonus. But I will say it has also already started gathering dust in the very corners at this 90 degree angle. And that's gonna be incredibly annoying and difficult to clean, no doubt. The buttons on the side of this phone, very clicky. They're in the opposite order though than pretty much every other phone that puts the power and volume on the same side. I'll probably get used to this though, but there's also actually a little indentation, if you can see it here, a little notch in between the power and volume buttons, and that actually makes the buttons feel like they travel more, you can feel the depth of the button a bit more as you're clicking them. And this indent is nowhere else on the phone, so it's pretty neat touch. And the 6 Pro also interrupts the stainless steel rails at the top for a matte black cutout, which I believe should be",325.56,621.843,104.38300000000001
Marques Brownlee,roWxo6jWoYw,Phone,Google,"for the millimeterwave 5G antennas that the smaller Pixel 6 does not have. You know what I do miss though, the Pixels used to always do those accent-colored power buttons. This one's just black on black. I like those accent power buttons, RIP. But yeah, that about covers it as far as differences between these two phones, as of right now. Of course, make sure you get subscribed to see the full review when that does come out of these, but essentially, what you're looking at is more screen, more battery, more camera, and more ram on the bigger phone. But yeah, from that, pretty much everything else is the same as far as specs, which kind of makes the Pixel 6 look like a much better deal. You know, they have the same chip inside, the Tensor Chip, of course. They both have 30-watt wired charging. They both have wireless charging. They share the same primary and ultra wide camera like the very same, oh, I almost forgot. The ultra wide selfie camera is back. That's pretty sweet. I was missing that in the previous Pixel. Happy it's back. But yeah, you know, they both have Android 12, a lot of the same features. It's just gonna be a matter of like, do you want a little bit of that extra for the 6 Pro? Oh, and of course, they're both promised five years of security updates, which is awesome for an Android phone. Good looks for the Pixel. But yeah, I'm gonna be off to testing these phones, Android 12, material, all of the new software features, and the things that make a Pixel a Pixel, which I'm really excited about, but let me know what you want to see in the full review. Let me know in the comments below. Either way, that's been it. Moving right along. It's the Techtober, there's more coming. Catch you on the next one. Peace.

Marques Brownlee,7hEPj13PUGc,Phone,Google,[Music] okay so uh i've held the pixel six let's talk about it all right so today we get a bunch of officially confirmed real details on the new pixel 6 and pixel 6 pro coming up this year from google i got some very brief off-camera hands-on time okay so i didn't get to shoot any of that but i have a lot of details and i have some official images that i can share with you so let's get into all of it so like i said there's a pixel 6 and a pixel 6 pro they're both pretty huge phones but the pixel 6 pro is a little bigger around 6.7 inches it has glossy metal rails instead of matte black rails and it is slightly curved on the sides of the screen it's 120 hertz screen instead of a flat 90 hertz on the smaller one there's also new camera hardware across both of them with a shared primary and ultra wide but there's also a new 4x telephoto camera on the pro and they have this horizontal camera bar across the whole back of the phone side to side that honestly it looks better in person than it does with the renders it kind of reminds me of a nexus 6p which also had a camera bar go all the way across the back and you can actually notice uh the metal rails on top and bottom of the camera bar are again glossy on the pro and matte black on the non-pro both up front will have a hole punch selfie camera in the middle and a nearly bezel-less display and of course both run android 12 with all the new aesthetics and material u and all those features so that's nice and that's exciting and there's a bunch more details to discuss closer to launch things like the exact battery size the screen resolution and of course prices but the one thing i want to talk about that's across both of these phones is the new custom designed silicon that will be in both of them called google tensor so this was rumored for a little bit you know pixel phones for years have been using a variety of snapdragon chips from qualcomm whatever's available just like every other high-end android phone but it was rumored that brewing in the background was this white chapel project of google designing their own silicon to eventually go into the pixel phone this,0.0,621.843,268.8
Marques Brownlee,7hEPj13PUGc,Phone,Google,turned out to be true so there's a couple different benefits to this and it's not even a new idea completely you know obviously apple designs all the chips in their iphones but also huawei makes the kirin chips and samsung makes exynos chips this is the thing that's been happening and there's even been little bits of custom silicon inside pixel phones before already they had a custom image signal processor called the pixel pixel visual core and then pixel neural core and also the the titan m security chip but this entire chip this whole phone being powered by just a tensor chip well that's a big deal i i think it's particularly important for the pixel line specifically because of how much google does with software and and that optimization process and i think i think we're going to see a lot of big changes here so let's start with the biggest i think most obvious place which is in their cameras so we all know by now that pixels have had really good photo quality specifically for a couple years now and that's because of their awesome software and computational photography but the video quality has always just been meh like not nothing special pretty average from the pixel and so what google showed me on pixel 6 was a comparison with the pixel 6 and the iphone 12 and the pixel 5. and of course this is a very you know handcrafted tailored comparison to show the best thing they could do but they're basically taking all those computational photography chops and applying them to video because tensor enables that now and it was really impressive what i was able to see we'll see much more hands-on demos of course i'm sure very soon but that's exciting that's the hdr that's the noise reduction the stabilization all of that smarts in video now too also you know pixel cameras have always been great but since pixel 2 they've basically been using the same kind of small at this point sensor because they've got it so dialed with their algorithms they can of course,139.52,621.843,238.95899999999995
Marques Brownlee,7hEPj13PUGc,Phone,Google,improve the glass and of course the iris opening every year but generally it's been the same sensor and i suspect they were reluctant to change it because why move to some huge new 50 megapixel sensor if you don't have the computational photography chops to back it up so they've just been sticking with the same sensor but this year with pixel 6 it is all new sensors big new sensors and i'm really curious to see what kind of results we're going to get with tensor and the image processing on these big new sensors now another benefit and the other sort of main pillar one that google was talking to me about was speech recognition and basically being able to do as much of this as possible on device as efficiently and quickly as possible beyond the google assistant is very important to them and i use assistant all the time so i'm happy to hear this but yeah just being as dedicated as possible by literally giving parts of the tensor chip that sole purpose of decoding speech into text and making things like assistant way faster and speaking of power i think battery life is another thing to keep an eye on with the tensor chip in pixel six so i don't have official battery size numbers if i get them from them i'll put them on the screen here but the point is do you remember when the max switched from intel design chips to apple designed m1 chips and literally doubled in battery life that's because of optimization and efficiency i'm not saying we're going to get that insane level of games here they're still both arm based you know tensor and qualcomm chips already arm based so same architecture but we are now approaching the same level of vertical integration that apple has had with those macs so maybe it'll be a little better i think the the streamlining of power and efficiency with tensor chips should make for a better battery experience but on top of all that now we got to think about you know android in general google makes android they can optimize for everything but also now they can offer much longer software updates much longer than other,258.479,621.843,233.20099999999996
Marques Brownlee,7hEPj13PUGc,Phone,Google,android phones as of right now technically you know android phones can offer software updates as long as qualcomm also officially supports those updates so typically you'll get something like three years which is nice but now that they control the entire stack they can optimize android for as many years as possible and they want to they want to optimize android for as long as possible to continue giving you updates because they want to keep you on that phone i feel like we've seen this kind of from the other side from the iphone apple has made a lot of money from selling iphones for a really long time but that slowed down a bit and now people are keeping their iphones longer than ever so apple realizes they they want to make as much money from the person with that iphone during the life cycle of that phone is possible so you've seen them move into services apple tv apple news all these services you can buy and pay monthly and then that iphone that you have for a long time will make apple a lot of money so with the pixel google already makes a majority of their money from ad services from things like gmail and google search and google assistant and so now tensor just enables them the ability to guarantee way longer software updates to keep you using that device way longer like the iphone now if you really want to go uh into the weeds i think this could also have an effect on pricing at least internally i don't want to get too crazy with it but google has had to to bargain with qualcomm to you know get a certain price for a certain order size for a certain number of chips but then samsung might come along and place like a way bigger order which could affect like the supply of certain ships and the whole supply chain is out of their control so with tensor it's it's better for google to have more control over this but obviously uh maybe not obviously but qualcomm has to bargain with their foundry and get certain prices and eventually upsell to oems like google so cutting out that middleman of qualcomm,375.6,621.843,242.55899999999997
Marques Brownlee,7hEPj13PUGc,Phone,Google,can actually save them money and make the price overall lower especially at scale and i don't know you know this might not get passed down to the user at any point maybe they use those savings for something else but it's just one more advantage to this but you know what actually one more thing i just came to mind this could be the beginning of an ecosystem-wide silicon thing for google you know the same way i keep going back to apple's example but the same way that m1 chip we've talked so much about is basically it's a scaled up version of the a14 i feel like there could be a scaled up or scaled down version of tensor in google's feature maybe a scaled down version for a pixel watch someday or a scaled up version for a chromebook or really any other device or a smart speaker or something like that or a smart display that would just make sense to happen down the line so yeah and that also makes sense for future parody because now you know the same reason the m1 max have better webcam quality than any other mac ever it's because they're using the same image processing as the iphone so for all of this i guess what i'm trying to say here is the first generation of tensor chip we're about to see in the pixel it's going to be really interesting to see what it unlocks to see how it performs obviously in regular day-to-day people are going to benchmark it and all that fun stuff but to see what type of stuff it really unlocks for the pixel now and then in future generations too so something to keep an eye on if you want to see uh my full video on android 12 and all the features that are already coming to the pixel when this phone comes out later this year i'll link that below like button if you want to check it out but that's been it for me just some quick thoughts on pixel six which is coming up coming up along with a bunch of other stuff if you want to be subscribed to see that of course you should thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace [Music],496.4,621.843,225.97899999999998
Marques Brownlee,XaqOejIaFgM,Phone,Samsung,"- All right, you have $1,300 to spend on an Android slab phone in 2024. Why would you get any other phone? No, seriously, why would you get any other phone? This S 24 Ultra has taken the best things from every other ultra high-end phone and stuffed them into one place, so anything that you could possibly value, it has pushed to the max. And there's just multiple cherries on top, just sprinkled all over the place. This phone sets the tone for 2024. (soft upbeat music) So the formula for Samsung's Ultra phones has evolved a little bit over the years. At first, it was just the most numbers, the biggest megapixel count, the most zoom and all that. Then it added the S Pen and got a little more refined and it replaced the Note. Now it's just everything. It's just everything in one place. It's all the best hardware, all the best software I can think of all in one phone. So on the outside, like I said in my early impressions, this phone looks almost the same as last year's phone, but if you think this phone is almost the same as last year's phone, turns out you're missing a lot. So the more you use this phone, the more you look for weaknesses, the more impressive it gets. So maybe what? You're a screen snob, right? You like to pixel peep, maybe you were thinking about getting one of the ultra high-end Oppo or Xiaomi phones just for an amazing screen. All right, well, look no further. Literally one of the best screens than any phone. S24 Ultra has dropped in a class leading 6.8 inch quad HD AMOLED display and it is awesome. These ultra phones have had 120Hz LTPO for a while and they've been this really sharp quad HD for a while now too. But now on top of that, two new things, one is it's completely flat and two is its much brighter. So there's been this whole new batch of like 2,500 plus nit phones in the past couple months that I've seen. This I think is the best looking one that I've seen so far. So now it's up to a max 2,600 nits, which is awesome outdoors or anywhere. But it also gets extremely dim at night too, without any of the weird banding I've seen in some other phones. And they flattened the display completely and brought the display right up to the very corners with some of the thinnest bezels we've seen all the way around. Plus there's also this new anti-reflective coating on this Gorilla Glass Armor that makes a noticeable difference with certain light hitting it at off axis angles. And then there is a crazy fast ultrasonic fingerprint reader underneath to top it all off. And you know, maybe I wish the touch target was a little bit bigger, but that's about it. Honestly, if you're a screen snob, it doesn't really get better than this one right here. This is the phone you should get. Okay, so what if your primary concern is battery life? Well, you could always get the Energizer phone that we saw at CES at one time, but as far as reasonably sized flagship slab phones go, it doesn't get much better than this. Again, they're keeping a 5,000mAh battery in one of the best performing battery phones from the past two years, despite making it thinner and keeping the S Pen. So you might as well get this one. Still got 45 watt wired charging, you still have 25 watt wireless charging and just battery life-wise, I was able to have long days with no problems, with six hours plus screen on time. I was able to baby it into getting two full days, that's at 1440p, at 120Hz and with high brightness use. So yeah, Why get anything else? So okay, what if then it's just performance is the main thing that you care about. Okay, so we're seeing all these phones with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 starting to come out and they're looking really good. Great high-end performance, there's efficiency gains all over the place, plus this phone pairs it with 12 gigs of RAM",0.0,621.843,209.98199999999997
Marques Brownlee,XaqOejIaFgM,Phone,Samsung,"and it is a multitasking champ. And if it's a stylus you're into, I already know you aren't really considering any other phone, the S Pen is basically the only high-end stylus still going in slab smartphones. It's really good for note-taking, drawing, highlighting, all that stuff. But if you're like me and you hardly ever use that, there's still the gaming performance and the everyday performance. There's the newly added rate tracing plus a 90% larger vapor chamber to cool the phone for much longer stuff. Turns out it's an A plus. Now you could always get a gaming phone and squeeze five to 10% more frames out of a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 with some huge badass cooling setup, and that's great, but then you also have to accept all of the sacrifices that come with said gaming phone over this. And do you really want those extra frames that bad? Depends on who you ask. Okay, cameras, there's a lot of other phones out there that you could buy if your 1,300 bucks specifically has to go to the best cameras. You know the Pixel just won the blind camera test. Sony has the best manual mode, like there's other great camera systems. But here's a way to simplify it, I think in evaluating smartphone cameras, there's basically two ways to review them. There's the utility, the actual technical evaluation, and the aesthetics, the art of it, the subjectivity part. And I think utility-wise, like on paper, specs-wise, this camera's got it all. Like you've seen this camera array before, there's four cameras on the back of this phone. Turns out, they're basically the same cameras as last year's S23 Ultra except for one. So there's a primary camera, an ultra wide and a pair of two different telephoto cameras. The primary camera is still the ridiculous 200 megapixel sensor with all the same pros and cons. It's consistent and versatile across the board. It has great dynamic range. It's a quick shooter with quick auto focus and it's also always bending down to 12 megapixels and you should almost never switch it to the 200 megapixel mode unless you have incredible lighting. It has an ultra wide with a bit of distortion near the edges, but it's actually meaningfully wider than the primary camera, so it's really fun to shoot with. Even though the automatic macro mode from it looks like trash and you should just turn it off anytime it turns your pictures from this to this, pro tip. And then it has a medium range, 3X telephoto camera that kicks in smoothly and matches the colors and exposure from the main camera really well. And so the one new thing in hardware this year is they've gone from a 10 megapixel, 10X camera to a 50 megapixel 5X camera. So technically, shorter optical zoom range, but I would say with the extra resolution, it is actually more powerful. It means all the photos in the gap between 5X and 10X look sharper than last year. And then you can literally put the 10X photos side by side from the S23 Ultra and the S24 Ultra and the new 5X cropped in actually looks better. Plus you can still zoom all the way in and shoot at a 100X if you still wanna take ultra stable pictures of far away objects like the moon. But basically what I'm saying is utility-wise, this camera system checks every single box. It has everything. So from there you get into the more subjective aesthetic differences which you could always lean one way or the other. I think, I mean, looking at these photos, they're still very much Samsung's slightly extra process-looking, a little bit extra contrasty, a little bit higher exposure, a little brighter colors, that still happens with these photos. So you could still convince yourself to lean Pixel or even iPhone, but if you just wanna be able to check every single box, why look anywhere else? Honestly, the changes that you notice more aside from the actual camera quality are just like features using it. Like the S24 Ultra shoots everything HDR by default now, it's actually in Google's new ultra HDR format.",221.85,621.843,227.663
Marques Brownlee,XaqOejIaFgM,Phone,Samsung,"So when you have specular highlights or big dynamic range differences in a photo, it will tastefully crank up that stuff for a more dramatic looking picture on the phone screen, similar to what Pixel and iPhone already do. And this passes through all the way from capturing the photo to viewing it in the gallery, and then one more step, to actually publishing it on social media. So Samsung has worked with Instagram and Snapchat for native quality photo and video uploading pipelines because at the end of the day, once you take the photo, what are you 99% of the time planning to do with it? Share it. And I think this is important for a lot of people, one of the reasons I have carried an iPhone for years is one of the things you can always count on is the photos and videos in third party apps are going to look just as good as if they were captured in the main camera. And now you can actually say that that is true now about photos and videos from this phone, at least in Instagram and Snapchat. All right, maybe you're a software person, maybe the top of your list when buying a new smartphone is you want the smartest smartphone. It's gotta have all the software and AI features. And honestly, it should have a nice long roadmap ahead of it of on-time software updates, sounds like I'm describing a Pixel but turns out, this phone now has a ton, a ton of helpful AI features built-in that are actually good, they make a meaningful difference to everyday use. Now the funny part about a lot of this is a lot of these features are made in partnership with Google, as you'll see. And I can't help but keep thinking like it feels like Samsung needs Google to have all of these features in their phone to compete especially against the iPhone. But then Google, now their own phones are a little bit less competitive, but it's probably worth the trade off because now technically they're helping to compete against the iPhone. It's this weird like thing where they need each other. I think it's fascinating and probably worth its own separate video, maybe let me know with a comment or by subscribing if you'd be down to see that. But that's all the background, all of this. So we were just talking about photos a second ago, the second you're done taking a photo and opening it up in Samsung's Gallery app, there's a ton of useful AI driven stuff that you can do with it. And it's kinda all based on what sort of scene it auto detects that you've taken. So lots of photos just end up with a remaster button where you click it and then it can add some contrast and brighten things up a little bit as needed and gives you a solid before and after. But if your photo has some glass or a window, it'll show you an Erase Reflections button and then you can literally go in and circle the reflections you wanna get rid of and it'll generative fill what should actually be in the glass. And it works pretty well. Now with this photo, I didn't take it in portrait mode but it's recognized that there's a subject and so it'll offer to add background blur. And even without a bunch of extra depth information, it analyzes the subject and it lets me add a little bit or a lot of background blur with a pretty good cutout, if you ask me, to just create a portrait mode shot out of thin air. But if you ever really, really wanna go crazy, there's a whole separate Magic Editor that feels exactly like what we just got with the Pixel minus any restrictions, it's never told me it can't do something. So you open any photo, hit that Edit button, and then there's this little blue green button with the stars, that's Samsung's new Magic Editor. And once you're here, you can just go nuts. You can move the subject around a photo and have a generative fill in the background. Or you can have it remove things entirely from the foreground or the background of a photo, like photo bombers or just unnecessary random objects. I actually found this super useful. But probably actually my favorite one, underrated, you know how normally when you need to tilt a photo,",451.02,621.843,214.97999999999996
Marques Brownlee,XaqOejIaFgM,Phone,Samsung,"like fix the horizon, you end up cropping in and losing some of the outside of the photo? You can still do that but with this Magic Editor, you can open it up and tilt the horizon to whatever angle you want, and instead of cropping, it will literally generative fill in the outsides of the photo, which works very well because usually the outside of the photo is the least important part of the photo. You can get away with generative fill. And by the way, literally all this stuff works with photos you download to the phone too, not just photos you've taken on the camera, but photos you just get wherever just like the Pixel. Now I also find it hilarious that if you use the Magic Editor to alter a photo on this phone, it'll add a little watermark to the bottom corner with these little stars so that you know that this photo was AI manipulated, which is good, that's a good responsible thing to do, especially if you're gonna upload this to social media. But then you can also immediately erase that watermark with a built-in object removal tool in Samsung's Photo Editor app. There's a nice little section in the settings where Samsung's tucked all of the AI features of this phone. It's called Advanced Intelligence, instead of artificial intelligence. Still AI though. That's where you get stuff like the live phone call translation feature or the new Voice Recorder app getting much improved speaker labels and summaries and transcriptions. The Samsung Browser will now do summaries of webpages. This might all sound very familiar, but the best new one in my opinion is Circle to Search. Now Google Lens has been around for a long time, in my opinion, one of Google's most underrated products. So people might have already known that you could basically do this already, but it would take several steps. Circle to Search, just makes it one step. It's much faster, it's pretty awesome. You literally just hold down on the home button or the gesture bar at the bottom and then circle or tap whatever on your screen that you wanna Google search and it just immediately Googles over the top of whatever you were doing without leaving that app and it's so useful. Just, even during the week I've been using this phone, I've searched pictures, parts of pictures before, it almost always works, just like uploading it to Google Lens. I've searched objects right in front of me through the camera view finder. I've searched random landmarks. You can also search text and you can even append text to your search. And I was just constantly impressed by how fast it is, and it basically works as expected every single time. The one fidgety part is sometimes selecting text gets a little weird. Using the S Pen can solve that a little bit to just get a more precise selection. But yeah, once you do it, it's much faster than if you're gonna use Google Lens, having to like take a screenshot and then upload it through Lens and then maybe have to crop it and the whole thing. This is just fast. Now real OGs will know that there used to be a feature on Pixels called Now on Tap. It was like the same exact thing, hold the home button and it would just Google whatever was on your screen and help you out but that was everything on your screen and they kinda ended up wrapping that into Google Assistant. This is just so much faster and more selective. Also, Pixels are gonna get this feature very soon as well. But then bonus points, if you really love software, Samsung is now promising seven years of security updates and seven generations of major software updates on this phone, on this S24 lineup. I assume seven generations of software updates is basically seven years. That means this phone will be up to date in 2031. Loving that. So we know the common wisdom was that if you wanted four, five, six plus years of software updates or if you want every single little software and AI feature, you basically had to go iPhone or Pixel. But now that this phone also has that, why get anything else? But speaking of the iPhone, they're going at them too. Now I know I said in the beginning of this video,",666.0,621.843,217.46699999999993
Marques Brownlee,XaqOejIaFgM,Phone,Samsung,"$1,300 slab Android phone, so I know the iPhone 15 Pro Max was never really on the table, but if we're being honest, Samsung has never been shy about competing directly against the iPhone, so why not take some of the best stuff from there too? They weren't being subtle about it. So they've got this shiny brand new titanium color with titanium rails on the S24 Ultra, just like the iPhone. They have flatten the screen and the sides and made boxier corners all the way through the lineup, just like the iPhone. They have moved to a max 5X telephoto lens like I talked about earlier, also just like the iPhone. They also have this new always on display that doesn't just show the time but shows your whole wallpaper now, kinda like it's half awake just like the iPhone. Thankfully, you can also turn that off and save some battery, just like the iPhone. You can also now long press to select an object in a photo that automatically cuts it out and makes it a sticker you can use in other apps, just like the iPhone. And there's even these new lock screen widgets now that look exactly like the iPhones, like copy my homework but don't even worry if they know you copied it. These two are gonna keep copying each other till the end of time, none of this is a surprise, it's just at the end of the day we are technically winning because they're making each other a little bit better bit by bit. But at the end of the day, S24 Ultra, I really do feel like, it feels like peak slab phone. And there's also a whole bunch of stuff I didn't even really mention with this phone. The haptics are really nice, I didn't even get to that. Now there's AI generated wallpapers, a whole section for 'em, if you're into that. And it's nice that the AI stuff is mostly kinda tucked away in ways where you don't ever have to use it if you don't want to, but if you notice it and it's helpful to you, bam, turn it on, could be your favorite feature. Really the only things that I miss, from the Pixel specifically, are Call Screening and Now Playing. So really the best argument not to buy this $1,300 phone is the fact that it's a $1,300 phone. And the truth is you can get 98% of the phone for much less money. You can see it in Samsung's own lineup. Samsung's own S24 Plus has a 4,900mAh battery instead of a 5,000. It has a 6.7 inch display instead of 6.8 and it drops the S Pen and one of the telephoto cameras for $300 off. And you know you can get the regular S24, again, for much less money with almost as much phone. So you don't have to spend 1,300 bucks on a phone. But if you are going to, and you put the word Ultra in the name and you stuff as much stuff in one phone as you possibly can, this is the one that you should get. This has all the things; it's reliable, it's fast, it does everything, it checks all the boxes, it sounds great. It kinda feels like an ad when I just say all these positive things about the phone but it's not. Until right now, this video is sponsored by Ridge. The Ridge Wallet is iconic at this point. It's a minimalist, modern wallets like the opposite of those old school wallets. It's got the patented dual track design that expands to hold one to 12 cards while being as slim as possible. And at this point, there's like 30 plus different colors and styles including carbon fiber, burnt titanium and forged ember. This one is the forged ember, so it's got these little red flex in it, which look cool. You can also get accessories for it, so if you wanna carry cash, you might want the money clip or this one has the cash strap.

Marques Brownlee,n7lM36yFh2Y,Phone,Samsung,"(bright music) - Yo, welcome to your first look at the Samsung Galaxy S24 Series. And I think they're way more interesting than they look on the outside. So we got three new phones today: Galaxy S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra. And as expected, yes, they look very similar to the S23 lineup, especially design-wise, but it's when you get under the hood and especially with software and the whole Samsung AI thing, that it gets way more interesting. So first, let me start with everything that's physically new, 'cause the list actually isn't long. So on the outside, S24 and S24+ are going to look just like last year, same dimensions, same body sizes, the camera rings, the button placement. There's just new colors: black, gray, violet and yellow. All matte instead of glossy, which I was not expecting, but I like it. And then it's squared off, basically exactly like an iPhone. Now, I know, you know, sometimes people say, oh, there's this feature that kind of resembles the iPhone or it looks a little like the iPhone. No, these flat sides and the flat screen look exactly like the iPhone all the way around, just being honest here, but now inside that body, the bezels are again, slightly thinner all the way around, making way for slightly larger displays on S24 and S24+. So now it's 6.2 inches and 6.7 inches, and then these panels themselves are actually sneaky major upgrades, especially the bigger one. So they're both now a ridiculously bright 2,600 nits, and the Plus that got bumped up from 1080 p to Quad HD, and it looks like you do have the option to use it at 120 hertz while it is Quad HD, just like the Ultra, which I mean, that's pretty sick. It's 1080 by default, but that's definitely an upgrade they didn't have to do and I appreciate that. And then the phones also have slightly larger batteries, both of 'em, up to 4,000 milliamp hours on the S24 and 4,900 milliamp hours on the S24+. And then the big dog, the S24 Ultra is actually even more tweaked. So again, it looks similar, obviously, but it's trimmed up just a tiny bit. It's just a little bit thinner, and then these side rails are now titanium instead of aluminum, whoever heard that before. And the display up at the front is now completely 100% flat from corner to corner, and I'm really liking it. So you might remember we went from having really dramatically curved edges on the old Ultra phones and Notes from back in the day, to a gentle curve,",0.253,621.843,139.87700000000007
Marques Brownlee,n7lM36yFh2Y,Phone,Samsung,"to almost no curve, but now it's no curve at all, which means it's totally flat, and there's actually much less bezels all the way around. And the screen goes to the very edges. And then also the Ultra is matte in all of its new colors, black like usual, but a new titanium color and a violet and yellow. Then on the inside they're all running the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip across the board. And then the cameras, the cameras appear to be more or less the same as last year with the S24 and S24+, but the S24 Ultra, they've shook it up just a little bit. So the Ultra phone we've gotten used to having this space zoom. So it was the 200 megapixel main camera, but then it had two telephotos: a 3x and a 10x. But with this new S24 Ultra, you still get the 200 megapixel main camera, but then a 3x telephoto and then a new 5x telephoto, which is kind of curious, but I actually think it makes sense here. Basically the 10x is a huge jump of zoom and I think Samsung is realizing not a lot of people are actually zooming to 10x, is just my theory anyway, so instead of having a 10x telephoto lens, which was only 10 megapixels, this new redesigned 5x is 50 megapixels. So the 5x, you know, that's a much more common zoom range, and then the higher megapixel count should mean that when you hit the 10x button that's in the camera, it crops into the middle 50% of the frame and you should still have nearly the same quality of a shot as the old low-res 10x. Now, this is all a theory, a lens theory, but I'm gonna have to test all this stuff out and of course see how well it works for the full review. So definitely make sure you get subscribed to see that when it comes out. Shout out to MatPat. Now, other than that, it feels like it's pretty much the same set of cameras across the board, and the Ultra that also still has a 5,000 milliamp-hour battery with the S-Pen slotted in the side as usual. So if you want all the new specs across the board, here's a nice little chart we've made for you, so you can pause and see the numbers and the prices and everything. I do wish to S24 started at 256 gigs in 2024, but anyway, we gotta talk about this new chip for a minute. So all these phones are running the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip across the board, great flagship chip, beginning of its life cycle, so you know, there's a couple phones trickling out with this one now, and there will be way more.",140.13,621.843,129.89999999999998
Marques Brownlee,n7lM36yFh2Y,Phone,Samsung,"And of course I have to test things, like the performance and the battery life and how heating works out, but it's also very clear that Qualcomm has built in a bunch of AI processing features into this chip. And so now it's up to the manufacturers who use the chip to decide what to do with it, and so there's phones coming out left and right with all kinds of AI features, and I think a lot of 'em are actually the most useful parts of some of these phones, and let me know if you agree. So the big one that I think most people will find the most useful on this phone is the instant visual search. So no matter where you are on the phone, whatever you're doing, if you just hold down the home button, or if you have gestures, just hold down the gesture bar, you can then either tap or circle something on your screen to instantly Google search it. And it's just, the few times I played with it, it's really fast, and this whole visual search feature thing, it's not like it's totally new. Like, we've had Reverse Image Search and Google Lens for years, but I'm loving the convenience of just, you know, being on a website, seeing an image or something you just wanna know more about, and then just long pressing, Googling it real quick, and getting the info. Or even something in your gallery, you know, maybe there's a landmark or something in a photo and you just Google the image. I mean I think it's awesome. I think people are gonna be probably using it a lot. It's also just something you have to spend a little time getting used to, 'cause everyone knows you can type things into Google, but to just visual search Google stuff, super useful. Then basically there's a bunch of other little places in the phone where you see the little stars, the little barred stars. If you see those, then you know there's some AI lurking ready to help you out, just press it. So the voice recorder app gets AI, so now it does much improved speaker labels and transcriptions, and it can actually summarize your voice recording after you record into a bunch of bullet points. The Notes app gets AI. Now it can do things like straighten out your handwriting or turn your notes into bullet points, or summarize your notes. It's just, you gotta find those little stars and press 'em. And the Galaxy S24 Ultra, it feels like it becomes more than just the ultimate note-taking device, but now it's even more useful on top",270.03,621.843,123.66
Marques Brownlee,n7lM36yFh2Y,Phone,Samsung,"of the already borderline magical handwriting recognition and all that stuff, so I love that. The phone app gets AI. So this stuff might start to sound familiar, but let's say you're gonna have a phone call with someone who speaks a different language. It will do live transcription and translation audibly in real time as you're having the conversation. So let's say I only speak English and you're gonna call someone who only speaks Korean, so you have to go into the phone app and download the language pack before the call, so it does all this transcription offline with a model stored on the device, and it seems like the models are, you know, somewhere from 100 to 500 megs each, and when you get on the phone, you just speak your language and the phone will visually and audibly translate what you're saying for the person on the other end. They hear their own language. Then they speak their language and the same thing. You hear them, but then you immediately hear a translated version in your own language. And it's pretty fast. I mean, I've never used live translation this smooth before. Now, I also don't speak Korean, so I'm not about to vouch for how accurate it is, but you know, I'm gonna try this with Spanish and try to verify a little more when I review the phone, but there's even the option to not even hear the other person speak, but just hear the translated voice, which is bold, but it also speaks to how accurate they think it is. And then of course the photo app gets AI. This one's not a shocker, but it's also kind of shocking how close it is to some other things that we've seen before. So once you have a photo, you hit the info button with the stars, and you can do a couple simple things like add background blur or erase an object in the background or remaster a photo, which seems like it's just doing some color and lighting and balance tweaks automatically. That's cool. It works. I think a lot of people will just find that stuff useful right off the bat, but once you go into the editor, you'll see in the bottom left hand corner a familiar group of stars that are back. It's literally a full on magic editor, just like the Pixel. (laughs) So you jump in there, you can circle things, highlight things to move around, and of course it's even more precise with the S-Pen, but then it literally does the same thing. It takes a few seconds to generate to fill the background, it plays a nice little animation, and then when it's done, it's spits out a few options of a new photo",393.69,621.843,131.07000000000002
Marques Brownlee,n7lM36yFh2Y,Phone,Samsung,"that is just completely fake. And also, I don't know, there seems to be less restrictions with this one than Google's, at least, because I remember the Pixel was very picky about letting me move people around, but I encountered nothing that this one was not willing to mess with, so the good thing is in the final result, there is a baked in watermark at the bottom left-hand corner. So you'll know in your gallery if you're looking at an image that has those stars as a watermark, that it didn't actually look like that when you captured it. And you can also apparently turn a regular video into a slow motion video as the AI generates new frames in between actually captured frames, and that can slow down the video for you. I don't know how well that's gonna work. Again, if it's as good as some of the generative AI stuff I've seen, could be shockingly good, but that's just another AI feature. Either way, clearly there's a lot going on. Now, it's kind of funny. Bixby (laughs) is like sort of the main character of AI on Samsung phones in the past, and I don't really see any indication that Bixby itself is actually taking big leaps forward. It's still on the phones. It still works, but we'll have to see. I'm gonna test that. I gotta test how good these screens are, how well these new cameras work, and all that stuff. And maybe there's some other stuff buried in that I haven't found yet that isn't just blatantly copying Apple's homework. And also, if you want your phone to look at least a little different, I checked with channel sponsor dbrand, and they confirmed that they're ready to go with the Grip Case shipping around the same time that Samsung will be shipping out these phones. One thing I've always liked about the Grip Case is they actually individually do the precise cutouts of the camera lenses instead of just one big lazy window cutout. Oh and bonus, they added MagSafe compatibility this year for the S24 series. So if you want a clean, protective, matte black magnetic case, well, that links in the description. Either way, let me know what you think of these new phones and let me know what you wanna see in the full review. (smooth music) Some interesting stuff here, I'll say that.

Marques Brownlee,zhoTX0RRXPQ,Phone,Samsung,"(upbeat techno music) - Matte black glass, aluminum rails, massive specs, quad cameras, a hidden stylus, oh wait, wait, hang on a sec. Yeah, no, that was the wrong phone, sorry. Let's start that over. (upbeat techno music) Matte black glass, aluminum rails, massive specs, quad cameras, a hidden stylus. You get the plan. (upbeat techno music continues) Hey, what's up, MKBHD here, and this is the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. So, when this first came out, when it got revealed, it was the easiest thing to do to just write it off as an incremental upgrade, because I mean, look at it. Aesthetically speaking, it's basically the same phone. The side radii are squared off more, so it feels a bit better in the hand, sure, much more boxy like the notes of the past. They're also slightly bigger rings around the cameras, and it's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 instead of Victus Plus, but as far as size, industrial design, button placement, ports, the layout, it's basically the same phone. But there are two real upgrades to this phone. Now keep in mind, this is replacing the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which was already my best big phone of the year from last year, great battery, great screen, great performance, all of it was rock solid across the board, so there's not a lot that I would naturally want to change. But, there are two things, and they're two of arguably the most important things you can actually change in a phone, the chip that runs it all and the cameras. So you might have heard about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. It's been a really good chip in the other phones that it's been in, excellent CPU and GPU performance and really efficient which touches battery life. Now, this phone, actually the whole S23 lineup, has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, a customized version of the chip, specifically for these Samsung phones. So if you watched the last video about how Apple's taking back the iPhone, then you know already that optimization and customization for parts inside phones is a good thing, generally. But the only thing that we've really seen that is customized for this chip for Galaxy is a slightly higher max clock speed on the performance core and slightly higher clock speed on the GPU. So to be exact, 3.36GHz instead of 3.2 on the performance core and 719MHz versus 680 on the GPU. So yeah, it does score slightly better on benchmarks than the regular Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and that's nice for a little extra headroom for high performance stuff, light gaming and for future-proofing, but that's not the whole story. There's two main things that matter here, one is efficiency gains. So, obviously performance is awesome, but because efficiency is better, these phones get some serious battery life gains that we'll talk in a second.",0.0,621.843,164.34100000000004
Marques Brownlee,zhoTX0RRXPQ,Phone,Samsung,"But also too, is bye-bye Exynos, because they're not making an Exynos version of this phone as far as I can tell anywhere else. They're shipping every S23 Ultra with a Qualcomm chip, so everyone gets the efficiency and performance gains from the Qualcomm version. So lemme tell you, the battery life on this phone is actually, it's been incredible, like it's really, really good. So it's the 5,000 million power cell again shouldn't be a surprise, but with this huge screen, I guess it kind of is actually a surprise. I had a two-day period at 120Hz but 1080P, where the only time I charged it was on the wireless charger in my car on the way to and from the studio for like the 40 minutes that that drive is. I didn't charge it overnight or anything like that. Two full packed days of high brightness, high intensity, normal use for me, has something like eight and a half hours of screen-on time. I'm in bed at like 11:00 PM at the end of the second day streaming on YouTube live watching LeBron break Kareem's record, it's still got like 10% left, it just won't die. So combine this excellent battery life with a pretty solid 45 watt charging that can go zero to 100 in an hour, plus wireless charging, and you've got yourself a battery monster, it's super good. I don't think enough people are talking about how much better the battery got. Maybe someone will do one of those crazy long runtime demos versus the past phone, but yeah, it's really good, probably better than you think. You kind of don't ever need to switch to 1080P to save batteries, matter of fact, when you take it out of the box, immediately just go in and switch it to 1440P, 'cause you spent 1200 bucks on this phone, and it lasts forever, treat yourself. Okay anyway, that's the chips, that's what that enables, but there's also a new set of cameras, hardware and software across the board that also is better than you think. Now, the fundamentals are mostly the same, which is why this probably gets written off so quickly a lot. The layout, the aesthetics, the focal lengths, the arrangement, it's all practically the same, but we have a new 200-megapixel primary camera with double the optical image stabilization range as before. That's hugely important. And then new sensors across the ultra wide, the 3X telephoto, and the 10X periscope cameras. This new primary sensor setup though, I know we keep saying cameras are mostly software, and as far as the look and style of the photos, it absolutely still is, but the improvement to the stabilization is so important here. So when you go from a normal sensor to a super-high resolution 200-megapixel sensor, the fact is, in these tiny smartphone cameras, the individual pixels are so small that individually, they physically can't bring in that much light. So the camera does this thing called binning, where it combines the information from a bunch of adjacent pixels",166.89,621.843,160.32000000000002
Marques Brownlee,zhoTX0RRXPQ,Phone,Samsung,"to form larger more accurate pixels in your image. So you're not shooting 200 megapixels by default, it's actually binning 16 pixels into one, so you end up taking a 12.5 megapixel shot for normal photos, but each photo is theoretically more accurate thanks to its makeup. And then like I said, the stabilization performance on this new primary camera has doubled. (phone rattles) Still rattles a little bit, but that means it'll correct up to three degrees of shake now versus the 1.5 from before, so here's an example of what's happening. If you get a lens with really good optical image stabilization, (lens rattles) like this one, that means it can correct from the movement in your hand much more, which means you can hold the camera stable for much longer, so it can leave the shutter open to collect more light and still get a sharp photo. So, all of this is to say Galaxy S23 Ultra photos, most of the time, in most lighting, look pretty similar to last year. So if that's all you're looking at, just normal side by sides, this is mostly gonna come down to the different software tuning, and there's a little bit more dynamic range than last year, but yeah, still top of the line while mostly avoiding looking to HDR-y. Photos are typically pretty warm from these Samsung phones, and they have a slightly punchier, more contrasty look than before, still very much up the Samsung alley of colorful and saturated, but it's an aesthetic that I can get behind, I really like. But, on top of that, having this new sensor and optical stabilization means one, you can shoot literally 200-megapixel photos now if you really want to. Now, this does accomplish the intended purpose of capturing much more of the finer detail in things like landscapes, so if you plan on zooming in on the shot later, or if you're one of the three people on earth who will actually print a smartphone photo, this should work, but you should also be aware that it's only really able to give you these types of results in excellent lighting where a ton of light is hitting every individual little pixel. Anything short of that, and you're gonna get a lot of noise really quick. And there's also a really solid shutter lag as it turns out these massive 40, 50 megabyte files, granted this mode is mostly for things sitting still, like a landscape or a photo shoot but worth noting. I think the better compromise is you actually also get a 50-megapixel mode, which kicks out still very detailed images that hang right with the iPhone's 48-megapixel ProRAW shots in a variety of light, but now the files are five megabytes, and there's a lot of less shutter lag. But there's still that improved detail over the normal binge shots and not as much noise. It's all about flexibility. The standard mode is gonna be the best for most shots most of the time,",327.21,621.843,154.44299999999998
Marques Brownlee,zhoTX0RRXPQ,Phone,Samsung,"but you can always turn it up if you want to, and that's very much the same thing with the zoom. You see all the cameras on the back. Any phone with two different telephoto cameras is gonna have the biggest range of good zoom performance. On this phone, anything past 10X is where it really shines compared to others. And you might have even seen my recent clip of taking a photo of the full moon recently, which seems to blow people's minds every time they see it. Wow, but you also can't forget about video too. This is improved video across the board with better processing, the new sensors, and the much better stabilization, thanks to the better OIS. So this might be the best super steady mode I've ever seen in smartphone video, and the beauty of it being from optical stabilization is it works great in a variety of lighting, unlike some electronic image stabilization, which relies on having a ton of light. And on top of all of that, the 8K video on this smartphone is very usable. There are previous phones that have had 8K video, it's not the first, but I remember when they first got that capability, they'd always be at like 24 FPS, 'cause that's the most that they could churn out, which is not the right frame rate, so 8K/30 really good. And if you put it side-by-side with the 4K, you can actually see the sharpness difference if you really punch in. If you want a sample of this, the latest Auto Focus video I shot in my car is in 8K from this phone, and you can actually go watch it 8K on YouTube right now from the link below, hit that like button if you want to. Oh yeah, and also, don't forget about the better selfies too. There's a new 12 megapixel selfie camera in all these S23 phones. And while that number is lower on paper than the 40 megapixel selfie camera that came before it, it's better. It's just better, rock solid proof that the megapixels don't matter. This selfie camera, with the better software processing, is very sharp, detailed, has nice color, doesn't flare too much, and also has a decently wide angle. It's not ultra-wide but not bad. So across the board, this is significant, an extensive improvement to the camera, especially the primary camera. That feels overlooked to me when people have been reviewing the phone. The one thing I still will complain about is there is still shutter lag, which is different from slow shutter speed. So the time gap between hitting the shutter button and actually capturing the photo, it's still real, and it can still be kind of annoying, even if you capture a crisp photo of the wrong moment. So, like I said, it's more pronounced when you take the ultra high resolution 50-megapixel or 200-megapixel photos. You can't exactly do those in rapid fire. But if the question is, ""Did they make a meaningful improvement",482.55,621.843,149.61699999999996
Marques Brownlee,zhoTX0RRXPQ,Phone,Samsung,"""to last year's phone to end up here?"" I would say between the new chip and the better overall performance, and much better efficiency, which gets you huge battery life improvement, and the new cameras with the better sensors, better processing, but also much better stabilization, I would say yes, not upgrade from last year's phone, yes, but they've actually made a real improvement. And then, I don't really need to say too much about the rest because it's the same as before, which, in the case of the best big phone of last year, is kind of a good thing. All the other things that made this the best big phone are still here, and they're not minor things either. I haven't even talked about the A+ display, 1440P, 120Hz LTPO, 1,750 nits peak brightness, it's still awesome, still has great speakers, still has very reliable software with a pretty good track record now of delivering software updates in a timely fashion for a while. The base storage has also actually jumped up from 128 to 256 gigs, and it's faster UFS 4.0 storage now. It still has the best stylus in a smartphone in the world, which might mean a lot more to you than it does to me, but, honestly, if I ever use it, it's nice knowing I can at any time mark up a screenshot or sign a PDF. And the list goes on, great haptic motor, nice clicky buttons, it's all still here. This thing sets the standard pretty high. My analogy that I was making is that it feels like the portion 9/11 of smartphones. If you're gonna charge 1200 bucks for a phone, it better set high marks all the way across the board, but it does, and it's pretty underrated, kind of boring, but it does. Now, if you want the S23 Ultra to look as improved as it actually is, I would recommend a skin from channel sponsored, dbrand, maybe something like this Damascus skin, which adds a lot of character, where it would ordinarily be pretty blank. My favorite one is the Triple Black. It is actually included for free when you pick up any of the holographic colorways, so you can check 'em out at the link below. I say this phone is boring, and I think maybe understated is the better word. Are there gonna be other phones that come out this year that do one up this phone in certain single categories? Yeah, 100%, there's probably gonna be a phone with 120X zoom. There's probably gonna be a phone with crazy fast charging. This is only 45 watt charging. Do I wish this was better? A little bit, sometimes. Is there gonna be a phone probably with a much bigger, better, faster fingerprint reader? (soft bright music) Yeah, probably. But as far as just nailing all the marks across the board, yeah, this does it. Just as far as overall package, Samsung's software is settled, the screen is sublime, it's still the sickest stylus, and it's snaps significantly smoother shots, sick. Thanks for watching, catch you guys in the next one, peace. (bright music continues)",632.167,621.843,165.22599999999997

Marques Brownlee,9kxTOxDGLqs,Phone,Samsung,foreign so we do have some new Samsung phones for early in the year as we usually expect them this time it's s23 s23 plus and s23 Ultra spoiler alert I've played with them for like two hours they are very similar to last year's phones which is great those were Rock Solid but that also means that I can probably make this like the shortest MKBHD video of the past year so I'm going to try let's get through it okay so the lineup is s23 s23 plus and s23 Ultra but there are the same four colors across the entire lineup so Phantom black green lavender and cream all pretty tame looking I think and as expected the s23 and s23 plus are basically identical other than their size which means you can either get the smaller one with the 6.1 inch 1080p OLED and a 3900 milliamp hour battery or the bigger one with the 6.6 inch 1080p OLED and a 4700 milliamp hour battery also the bigger one apparently has slightly faster wired charging 45 Watts Peak versus 25 and a higher base storage there's 128 on the small one but 256 gigs starting on the plus that's it so aside from that you're looking at the same general shape and design as last year flat display you know the ports and the speakers at the bottom the button locations look basically the same still got wireless charging still got IP ratings really the only thing that's updated here from the s22s are the chip and the cameras so the,1.199,621.843,174.10199999999998
Marques Brownlee,9kxTOxDGLqs,Phone,Samsung,new chips are the Snapdragon 8 gen 2. and if you pay attention to the presentation Samsung's doing this thing where they're calling it like Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy as if it's sort of a customized ship but when I asked Samsung about this it seems like basically they're doing a slightly higher Max clock speed maybe it's just binning for all we know so I don't expect it to be a dramatic difference versus other phones that just have Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 but you know that's something we'll test we'll see in the full review but I mean you know the phones feel fast and Samsung phones always feel this fast when they're brand new so I'm not super worried but the other new thing that I mentioned is the cameras so these new camera systems are refreshed across the board new sensors New Image processing new AI remastering of photos so it's a 50 megapixel main camera paired with a 12 megapixel Ultra wide and a 3X telephoto playing with it briefly you know the images I took I thought actually looked really good it's obviously a super brightly lit setup room so I will say they also look very hdre and dare I say a bit pixely in this situation but that tracks with Samsung's claims of a much better improved dynamic range I'm just very curious to get these out into the real world and see how it Stacks up so definitely get subscribed to see the review when that comes out and I can actually test them one thing I,89.64,621.843,145.67999999999998
Marques Brownlee,9kxTOxDGLqs,Phone,Samsung,saw that I didn't like though was the presence of a bit of shutter lag this isn't exactly new with some Samsung phones but sometimes you take a photo of something fast moving and you think you got it but then it turns out the image was captured slightly later than when your finger hit the shutter so something to keep an eye on just because if I notice it in this perfect lighting it's probably going to strike again but but there is also a new selfie Camera 12 megapixels just a lot of new Imaging stuff here so that's that's mainly what's new with this incremental s23 update so s23 starts at 7.99 and s23 plus starts at 9.99 if you're really trying to pay 200 more dollars for the bigger phone but there's also the 1199 s23 Ultra again a pretty similar design to last year but as you may have noticed there's really two noticeable changes for those of us who have touched and held last year's phone one the camera bumps are all just a little bit bigger with these new pronounced rings around them I'll talk about the new cameras in a second but then two when you're holding it in the hand they've changed the shape of the sides to be much more flat so the whole phone is just much more boxy and I like it I really like it Samsung says this was a reshaped curve at the edges to better optimize for the S Pen that is still here I assume this would mean either they're making room for a slightly bigger battery or maybe,163.08,621.843,156.9
Marques Brownlee,9kxTOxDGLqs,Phone,Samsung,they can compress the dimensions and make a slightly smaller phone but the battery size is still the huge 5000 milliamp hours from last year and the phone is still huge so I mean it feels like it's mostly for Aesthetics and feel in the hand and just have something different from last year but I do I actually really like it I also did notice interestingly some of these phones I was recording with were flickering more than usual but just on camera like I'm not aware of any big differences in the Adaptive refresh rates these are still ltpo displays that go from one to 120 hertz and I played with a few settings when I noticed it flickering but I couldn't really figure it out not that it's a big deal it didn't flicker to my eyes and these are great looking screens with a new Peak brightness of 1750 nits across the board which is excellent but that's just something different that I noticed to keep my eye on really though the cameras are the biggest thing in the ultra refresh as well again new sensors across the board headlined by a 200 megapixel main camera there's also the 12 megapixel Ultra wide and a pair pair of telephoto cameras 3x and the 10x there's going to be a bunch of new camera stuff to test in here from the improved Optical image stabilization across the board to the better low light performance maybe with 16 pixels binning into one and kicking out a 12 megapixel,241.56,621.843,154.98000000000002
Marques Brownlee,9kxTOxDGLqs,Phone,Samsung,photo to the Galaxy camera feature integration in certain apps like Instagram and also the 200 megapixel mode I want to see how good the actual 200 megapixel files really are not that I print out photos and set them on canvas or anything but you could if you wanted to but I think it's clear the bottom line is the camera system is one of the biggest differentiators between the ultra and the rest of the lineup aside from that it's going to be a pretty familiar phone to the one that I gave the best big smartphone award last year it's still a 6.8 inch edge to edge 1440p OLED display there's still the you know Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy you can get up to a terabyte of storage still the IP rating we already know there will be no Chargers in any of the boxes so this video sponsor anchor is Ace charger is definitely the move here this 313 charger is way smaller than Samsung's official one thanks to gallium nitride AKA Gan technology plus it folds up but it'll still guarantee the 45 watts of peak charging power that the ultra supports with super fast charging 2.0 so it fully charges in about an hour and it does it safely with things like current regulation over temperature protection and more or there's there a 312 charger which is a good pair to match with a 25 watt Peak charging of the s23 and still smaller and more efficient than Samsung's so if you're looking for a powerful charger for s23 s23 Plus or s23 Ultra this Anker Ace charger is the move and I'm going to link it below [Music],318.6,621.843,169.08800000000002
Marques Brownlee,vXIAB_1FEC0,Phone,Samsung,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and this is the brand new galaxy s22 ultra i've been using it for about two weeks now and i promise you i'm not going to call this the note 22 ultra over and over again in this review i swear i can make it through this video without making that joke but really the bottom line here to understand this phone the best really is like if you took the name off of this phone what samsung is giving you for the money is a galaxy note but the phone that i'm reviewing and using is called the s22 ultra let's get into it so the word ultra in samsung's lineup has basically come to just mean the highest ambitions the biggest numbers the best specs and the most features overall it's just that now the ultra name has swallowed up the note stuff too so note used to be that one special edition phone with the squared off design the flat top and bottom and the pen built in now that's just all wrapped up into ultra and the s22 ultra does not miss a beat with all the ultra stuff they're packing in the highest end ship they can that's the snapdragon 8gen one here in the us with a massive new cooling solution alongside it the ram is technically down from last year the base model has eight gigs and all the rest have 12 and there's no more 16 gig version but i honestly don't miss that i can't imagine someone really needing 16 gigs of ram in their phone right now but you absolutely can go up to one terabyte of non-expandable storage though but this display this display is also excellent it's a huge 6.8 inch 1440p ammo led at 120 hertz with a 240 hertz touch sample rate and the big new number is a max brightness of 1750 nits now on the one hand i don't want to overreact about 1750 nits like it's a big number but brightness works on a logarithmic scale so this 1750 is not dramatically brighter than the 1500 max from last year's s21 ultra these phones are all very sunlight readable but i do still want to give samsung credit for continuing to improve an already best-in-class display and making it even better it still got the same great ultrasonic fingerprint reader as last year right under the middle of the screen and still has a hole punch camera in the top middle and it's an ltpo2 panel now which means in addition to being really responsive it can drop that refresh rate as low as 1 hertz when there's nothing moving on the screen really my only dislike with this display is the curve over the edges so if you look at this phone next to last year's s21 ultra obviously these phones are different shapes and the displays are actually slightly different resolutions and this new shape definitely curves more over the sides which i don't like as much other than that this is an awesome ultra display and we all know it's not an ultra without a massive battery so yeah 5000 milliamp hour,8.69,621.843,330.5099999999999
Marques Brownlee,vXIAB_1FEC0,Phone,Samsung,should do the trick now interestingly there are some tests online showing that it doesn't last as long as last year's 5000 milliamp hour battery and you can see a roon mister who's the boss did a variety of things in his test and found the s21 ultra did last a bit longer than this phone and to me when i see that i'm like okay there's a variety of factors that can contribute to that one the slightly better display two a little bit more of a power hungry chip that runs hotter in the snapdragon 8 gen 1 but generally my battery experience has been very very good i actually never killed it in a day never really got anywhere close easily ending heavy days with 30 40 plus percent battery left and could extrapolate about seven hours of screen on time out of a charge which is great for me i know screen on time is different for everyone but it's been great plus on top of that it does charge a bit faster than last year up to 45 watt peak charging if you buy that fifty dollar optional brick so i'm glad they fit that big 5000 milliamp hour cell in here despite also adding the s pen which takes up a whole column along the inside of the phone but speaking of that s pen that's what's new the note stuff now i'm personally not the biggest s pen user i think i say this every time i review a note like i think i signed one pdf last week with it which was really convenient but you know i did it once and i used samsung's handwriting recognition in the notes app super cool that it works really well and you can search what you've written and i also i just enjoy that it still clicks a lot like that so it is definitely impressive i still think it's the best stylist in any phone and it's literally got all the features the last notes had smart select is nice for screenshots and annotating things lock screen quick notes are still super convenient if you use samsung notes and it even still has that long distance bluetooth connection that lets you use the button on the s pen to remote control take photos without touching the phone and the new display brings latency down from nine milliseconds which is already pretty good all the way down to 2.8 milliseconds which to me basically feels like real time you know i'm not an artist who's doing massive drawings or extremely precise sketch work with the pen it's just casual writing and so the fact that it uses ai to predict where the pen is going to go and starts drawing those pixels slightly ahead of where the panel is actually registering it is pretty next level so to me this this is as close to one to one as it gets but at the end of the day if you see all this and you're like i still probably won't really use any of it then you can just slot the pen right back into the phone and never use it it's out of the way and the,173.68,621.843,301.75899999999996
Marques Brownlee,vXIAB_1FEC0,Phone,Samsung,phone didn't make any sacrifices to include it so okay here's a bunch of other smaller things that i noticed from using this phone every day that you should too if you're planning on getting one so the speakers are excellent they get very loud and sound crisp and clear like last year some of the best in any smartphone so that's great for watching media but then the display curving more over the edges than last year makes it worse for watching videos and then the vibration motor this is a small thing but i mentioned it also in the s22 review they changed the type so it went from a z-axis vibration motor to an x-axis vibration motor it doesn't sound like much but it changes the way it feels so it feels just as strong and precise and clean for typing or swiping or holding it in your hand but it's way less strong when it's on a desk or in your pocket so i literally missed phone calls with my phone sitting right in front of me vibrating on my desk because i didn't hear it or feel it [Music] then the camera rings so they're a bit of a controversial design sure but like most designs you kind of get used to looking at it but you never ever fully get it clean of dust so if you go caseless like me not only does the phone sit kind of funny on a table but there will also always be dust between the camera rings so just get ready for that i would actually recommend if you get a case channel sponsor dbrand just dropped their atomic edition grip case and it doesn't do a huge cutout all the way around the cameras like i thought we might see in my impressions video it actually just matches the camera rings and it looks way cleaner and it's just deep enough to protect the cameras if you drop it so this is definitely the way to go you can check it out at the link below then this phone just like the other s22s shoots 8k video at 24 fps you know the wrong frame rate give us the option for 30 samsung just put it in the settings somewhere but even worse than not having the 30fps toggle it actually crops in way more than the regular s22s so turns out shooting 8k is 33 megapixels and it's actually cropping in to the middle 33 megapixels of this huge 108 megapixel sensor so when you switch to 8k you zoom in to what feels like about 2x which is pretty inconvenient for framing no ak video from the ultrawide or the telephoto lenses this is a bit of a downside and then there is absolutely still some shutter lag with this main camera more than the regular s22s again and this is understandable with all the processing happening but it definitely felt like i was missing some shots or having trouble capturing moving objects because of the bit of a delay between the shutter press and the actual photo being taken but speaking of cameras,324.479,621.843,311.1399999999999
Marques Brownlee,vXIAB_1FEC0,Phone,Samsung,let's just get the camera stuff out of the way it's funny because this is probably what most people actually come to these review videos for if you think about it if you watch a smartphone presentation these days 75 of a new phone presentation today especially a flagship is camera stuff so that's one of the biggest things that differentiates these phones and on a 1200 phone it's one of the most important features so how is it well you can see they went with basically the same layout of this set of cameras as last year it's 108 megapixel primary camera the ultra wide the 3x telephoto and the 10x telephoto plus laser autofocus and they're not the same exact hardware as last year but they're pretty close and that's a good thing and samsung is not messing around with their cameras these are definitely flagship quality and i'm really happy with them matter of fact i don't even have much to say about image quality because there really isn't much new here but there are some new features within the camera modes that might sort of unlock some new things and be different about this phone so i'm gonna go over those with you one by one so first the more accurate portrait mode now i think i tweeted a couple months ago sort of ruffled some feathers but i said something like samsung has the best like portrait mode on smartphones right now and i understandably ruffled some feathers but i should clarify basically what i mean is their cutouts have been the most consistent and the most accurate of portrait modes among smartphones that i've seen so that doesn't mean the the blur is the most natural or the falloff is the most realistic i just mean they make the least errors with like ears and hair and shirts and stuff and so this year they're planning on well they've announced that they're doing it even better they've got ai stereo depth mapping for portrait mode that they claim can cut out things as small as a single human hair which would be cool it's not exactly accurate but they say it's better so i still found it to be really good but it's definitely not perfect it still misses some stuff sometimes but i stand by my statement these cutouts and depth mapping they're doing is really really good the portrait mode shots especially look good with the 3x lens with people with pets even and also with inanimate objects that still does a good job cutting stuff out again not perfect you'll pretty much always find some error in every smartphone portrait mode shot but samsung does a really good job i think the 1x portrait shots are good to have but they don't look as natural so i hope samsung works on the naturalness and fall off of the,483.44,621.843,288.1610000000001
Marques Brownlee,vXIAB_1FEC0,Phone,Samsung,background blur to overall make it the best portrait mode then there is night photography which samsung has called nightography okay so i compared the night mode shots to the iphone 13 pro which also has an excellent camera and my biggest takeaway is yes samsung's night mode photos are definitely more detailed 100 but they're also dramatically brighter as advertised they're letting in a lot of light and the photos in the dark look like you're taking them in a lot more light than you actually have especially look at the sky back there so it's impressive but it's also a bit of a preference thing some people want their nighttime photos to look like they're at night but then lastly there is an expert raw app separate from the camera app that can take raw photos that includes multi-frame computational photography data hdr and everything and the differences are subtle but they absolutely do allow for more latitude when editing so photographers should definitely grab this app from the ugliest app store i've seen in a while the samsung galaxy store so i'm going to end it with this you know typically the big question with the review at the end of the review you're like well should i buy it is it worth it and this is an expensive phone it's 1200 bucks so that's a big question so basically i think their mission was accomplished the fact that they combined the note stuff with this phone makes it easier to separate from the regular s22s it makes it a more obviously different phone in the lineup so if you just want like a standard really good flagship phone big screen nice battery nice cameras all that stuff the s22 plus is a great phone and it's 200 less at the starting price but if you want some specific extra things like the super high resolution display or the s pen or some of those camera tweaks then that gives you a reason to upgrade and it does deliver on those extra things now that being said i am sticking with the galaxy s21 ultra as my main daily driver phone obviously people who have this phone don't need to upgrade but it's just basically the same phone as far as software battery cameras are almost the same performance is the same but uh with a design that i prefer and a vibration motor that actually notifies me more often but yeah overall this phone is good it delivers if you want a little bit of a more in-depth look at the one ui 4.1 software and the fact that this phone at least this lineup with the s22 for samsung seems to be basically the default android experience more so than google's pixel ever could be definitely watch my s22 review i'll leave a like button if you want to watch that real quick but that's been basically it thanks for watching catch you guys later peace,627.44,621.843,318.1599999999999
Marques Brownlee,qWIkBMNKj1s,Phone,Samsung,[Music] so what do the early 2000s san antonio spurs and the current day phoenix suns and the galaxy s 22 series all have in common well they're all drama-free they're all kind of a bit boring and all quietly really really good so those spurs weren't really just a one-trick pony of being more athletic or dunking all over the top of people or just shooting tons of three-pointers or really any of the things that a casual fan would immediately appreciate just good solid fundamentals ball movement high percentage shots and sharing the load same kind of thing with the phoenix suns of today they don't necessarily have one huge standout mvp superstar but like the whole team is really really good and there aren't really any weaknesses and they're quietly the number one team in basketball this phone is boring like i'm not the only one who's thought that and said that but that's what happens when a phone gets so really good across the board that there aren't really any weaknesses because they didn't really take any huge risks they just took a good thing and made it better so i appreciate that you know what you're getting with a samsung flagship very similar design to last year just a little bit smaller and a little more squared off and with glass on the back now instead of plastic that little spot where your finger rests under the camera bump too if you use it without a case it's a little more sharp but i got used to that pretty quickly but we all expect an ip68 water resistant phone solid speakers clicky buttons the best ultrasonic fingerprint reader in the game a nice satin finish you know not all of these things can be said about every other phone but they're all here and i even want to give a shout out to the in the hand feel of the smaller galaxy s22 so i talk about in the hand feel all the time but samsung made both of these phones smaller than last year the s22 plus went from 6.7 inches to 6.6 diagonally still big but then the smaller s22 went from 6.2 to 6.1 inches and dare i say it has a bit of a compact feel to it now obviously it sounds crazy to say that about a phone that still has a six inch screen but the fact that i'm coming from bigger phones combined with the flat sides and the tiny symmetrical bezels and the corner to corner display this has me feeling like it's about as compact as the phone can possibly be and i'm almost tempted to have it in the running for maybe compact phone of the year maybe it just holds that lead for right now in february but speaking of displays that's the one thing that we definitely know samsung two have been good at for a long time this year though there was a bit of confusion around them so let's clear that up so both the s22,0.0,621.843,309.9189999999999
Marques Brownlee,qWIkBMNKj1s,Phone,Samsung,and s22 plus have flat 1080p 120 hertz adaptive ammo led panels the plus is obviously bigger and it also has the higher max brightness of 1750 nits where the s22 gets up to a very respectable 1300 nits they're both very viewable outdoors although the peak brightness on the bigger phones and also the ultra is crazy bright like you can view it in direct sunlight it's awesome but there was a question about whether these were ltpo displays or not so that's that newer tech that allows you to modulate the display refresh rate down to 10 hertz to save battery so i'd ask samsung and i mentioned this in the impressions video that they told me that these are not ltpo displays but then at the same time on the spec sheet it also said that these go from 10 to 120 hertz so that was a bit confusing but now a few days later if you check samsung's actually changed those spec sheets and their website saying it can go from 48 to 120 hertz so they clarified that data transfer rates to the display can go as low as 10 hertz but the display is still refreshing faster so they updated their site to reflect the widely recognized industry standard of the actual refresh rate huh it's almost like some other companies sometimes lie to people by expressing things in other non-standard ways anyway so it's not the full variable refresh rate range of ltpo2 like we have on the ultra which is a bit of a downside to an 800 to a thousand dollar phone but aside from that it's a great bright responsive display in this adaptive mode and that's what matters most to me i did notice there's still some situations and still a few apps where it kicks down to 60 hertz on purpose like maps apps like waze and google maps and still the galaxy store app for some reason but with all the color customization and a really good auto brightness the only possible downside with this screen would be battery life and on top of that the only concern for me really going into reviewing these phones was the battery life because number one both the phones are smaller and so both of them have a 300 milliamp hour smaller battery than last year and number two the new snapdragon 8 gen 1 chip had some concerns about it it's that's obviously brand new and supposed to be very efficient but it also appears to be geared to be a very high-end chip very high performance so it performs really well puts up great numbers better than previous chips on benchmarks and it crushes gaming but it runs a little hot and if there's a reason almost every flagship you see coming out with this new chip also has like a huge section in their presentation about their new massive super innovative new cooling solution so with no ltpo smaller batteries and a potentially higher power drawing chip i was a little,163.2,621.843,325.91800000000006
Marques Brownlee,qWIkBMNKj1s,Phone,Samsung,concerned about battery life on these phones turned out to be fine not amazing not like headline making but san antonio spurs boring level good so david was testing the s22 plus most at the studio and got a solid day and a half of use so starting a day at 7 00 am and then getting to 1 pm the next day before the battery dies pretty solid and i was using a smaller s22 for a few days and had no problem ending a normal day with 10 to 20 percent left now if i did a lot of high brightness navigation and gaming big power draw stuff i could take big chunks out of this battery fast so that did not surprise me with this chip it is a more efficient four nanometer process node now so it does really well with standby but you can absolutely burn through it with heavy use something to keep in mind too though the s22 plus has a better overall battery experience because it also supports 45 watt fast charging instead of the 25 watts on the smaller phone now it doesn't come with it so it's 50 bucks extra to get that 45 watt charger but that's a difference to note you wanna know something i did find i like less about the s22 though than last year it's a subtle one but it's real the vibration motor so the haptics are still actually really good and really strong and clicky and responsive and i love that about it but they've switched from a z-axis vibration motor to an x-axis vibration motor it doesn't sound like it make a huge difference but that's a difference in the direction of the pulsing of the motor and that makes it a lot less strong in my pocket and on a table for feeling the vibrations i missed a lot of notifications just because it didn't strongly buzz me enough [Music] so yeah i don't know that was a subtle thing you can still feel the vibrations really well and turn vibration intensity all the way up but the direction is different not sure why maybe space savings but it's real maybe the most exciting potential superstar upgrade on these phones though is the cameras the s22 having a major camera upgrade would be like the 2016 golden state warriors signing kevin durant making them the clear number one favorite right you have a new 50 megapixel main camera a 10 megapixel 110 degree ultra wide and another 10 megapixel 3x telephoto camera but this new camera system is more harrison barnes than kevin durant meaning it's it's really good but it's not gonna blow your mind at how good it is i love that we take photos this good from a smartphone for granted you give it pretty much any normal lighting situation and handles it really well samsung's colors are nicely balanced,327.919,621.843,313.759
Marques Brownlee,qWIkBMNKj1s,Phone,Samsung,they've hit their stride with processing that isn't too overly sharp or saturated the ultrawide is definitely softer than the main camera but it still does well with a lot of light and the telephoto is rock solid no weird hdr haloing issues and pictures no white balance inconsistency problems no auto focus issues and pretty minimal shutter lag it's just boring tim duncan with the bank shot level solid also i i gotta say i love that it no longer punches into 3x when i shoot 8k video on the phone i know ak video is not the most popular feature but last time the higher resolution camera was the telephoto so if i shot 8k video it would punch into a 3x crop that was rough it doesn't do that anymore now it's just a tiny crop in on that main sensor which is actually a smaller crop than on the ultra because the ultra is cropping into the middle 33 megapixels of this massive 108 megapixel sensor so i'd actually rather shoot 8k video on the regular s22s than the s22 ultra now i'm not going to do it because it's still 24 fps which is the wrong frame rate shopped.onbc.com but still like why couldn't samsung add a little switch to make it 8k 30 if i wanted to the last three snapdragon chips have been able to support 8k 30fps video and i know you know 8k is supposed to be a super high end cinematic feature but at least buried in the settings let me do ak-30 if i want to i don't know maybe it's a samsung thing other phones have been able to do it not samsung now there are way more software improvements with these cameras like night photography which samsung calls knightography because they have to name everything for some reason but that's for better detail and night shots and ai stereo portrait mode improvements for better cutouts and space zoom stability locking and auto framing that can track up to 10 faces around a frame and a new separate expert raw app i'm going to talk way more about all this camera stuff in the s22 ultra review video which is coming soon definitely make sure you subscribe to see that one when it comes out but in this one i wanted to talk about its default status which you know especially in the u.s now it's kind of a running joke that outside of the tech community we've heard people call it like iphones and galaxies like they've just been so dominant here anyway that it's kind of already understood but especially with the s22 series now more than ever it's sort of solidified itself as the default android phone uh which is crazy when you consider what the pixel 6 was supposed to be now i used to rag on samsung's software for being incredibly clunky weighted down with bloatware looking like a cartoon skin on top of android while the pure google experience from a nexus or a pixel or even a lightweight,487.919,621.843,333.3610000000001
Marques Brownlee,qWIkBMNKj1s,Phone,Samsung,skin from motorola or oneplus was the way to go but today now that oxygen os has gone downhill and the pixels are a buggy mess samsung's one ui has evolved into easily one of the most stable performant feature-packed android experiences out there they loop in the google stuff when it's good like having a google page next to your home screen and the new material you wallpaper picker from android 12 which lets you pick colors from your wallpaper to be accent colors and the menus of your phone but then they also sprinkle in tons of their own samsung features that you can decide to use if you want but not only that samsung has also vaulted ahead and is doing some things better than google's own phones so one thing that i've noticed is there's a new google messages app as the default on all these samsung phones which is cool if you go to the play store and try to download google messages it says you already have it installed but when you open it it's a samsung skinned version they're the only ones who have been able to do that so now it has that half screen reachable ui to match the rest of samsung's one ui then there's a new google duo feature that launched where you can essentially watch a youtube video together with someone while on a video call like apple did with share play over facetime and this feature has launched in google duo on the galaxy s 22s only first why so you have to use a galaxy s22 or s22 ultra to use this feature which i did we tried it and it worked but there is no timeline for when this feature will show up on other android phones including google's own pixel even though google made this feature and then on top of that samsung is promising four years of software updates for the galaxy s22s after they launch that's more than the three years of software updates that google is promising with their own phone in the pixel you see what i'm getting at so the galaxy s 22s are boring yes but the boringness comes from them having basically no glaring flaws and makes them incredibly easy to recommend i wish they were more sustainable i wish they included a charger in the box so you didn't have to go out of your way to buy a 45 watt charger and make more waste to actually use that feature and i can appreciate that some plastics being used in the phone are made from recycled fishing nets but that's really only a tiny dent in the big picture of samsung's footprint but in that classic frequently asked question of like if you're in the market for a flagship phone right now and i don't know anything about you the first phones that i'm gonna bring up are the iphone 13 and the galaxy s 22 plus and they've earned that spot that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace,654.24,621.843,311.99999999999994
Marques Brownlee,ldadR6XqiWE,Phone,Samsung,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and this is the all new samsung galaxy s22 ultra freshly announced today and i got some hands-on time with this new flagship and you know what's funny we haven't had a new samsung galaxy note in two years since the note 20 in 2020 and so since then we've had all these questions like oh is samsung killing the galaxy note are they done with that line is it over but i have a theory this is a galaxy note now obviously not by name we're still calling this an s22 ultra but clearly you know samsung was looking for a little bit more of a way to differentiate the ultra from the rest of the galaxy s lineup and a reason to justify this 1200 starting price so honestly i wouldn't really be surprised if samsung did behind the scenes actually make an s22 ultra and a note 22 ultra and then look at them side by side and like yeah there's not really enough differentiating these here and then just booted the s22 ultra and kept the note 22 ultra and slotted it in at the top of the lineup but change the name so yes the phone i'm about to show you is called the galaxy s22 ultra but uh yeah the note is back so i picked this phone up and held it for the first time and immediately all the memories of previous galaxy notes come back now like i said this slots in right above the galaxy s22 and s22 plus i also have a video about those two new phones dropping at the same time as this one so if you're interested in those definitely check that out link below the like,0.38,621.843,190.979
Marques Brownlee,ldadR6XqiWE,Phone,Samsung,button but yeah this is the top of that lineup so the new design that was rumored is real the materials feel familiar you've got metal and gorilla glass victus plus you know the flat top and bottom the whole thing is ip68 certified and then the shape well this is the exact specific shape of the galaxy notes of the past just with a satin back now and the new camera layout the satin back i love seems like the word ultra is associated with like a satin or matte non-glossy back and i'm all about that and of course low key while i of course love the matte black i think the white one here will show the fewest fingerprints if you can keep it clean but the cameras are the weird looking part for sure there is no big camera bump no shelf on the corner like the s21 ultra just individual camera rings that each protrude out the same amount from that flat back and the camera rings are shiny and actually match the rails of the phone for each color but look i don't think it looks that great it looked pretty basic to me in the renders and it still does but honestly most other phones camera bumps look pretty lame too maybe this one looks a little dumber with a case on it because you have to draw around the camera cutouts and then it looks like the letter p shape kinda meh i don't know it's a good thing you don't have to look at the back of your phone all the time you can get a case you like or something like that it's just a bummer because the s21 series all looked so much better and the s22 and s22 plus both still have this better looking corner camera bump,95.759,621.843,179.521
Marques Brownlee,ldadR6XqiWE,Phone,Samsung,design anyway the display up front on the ultra appears to be everything you'd expect i think we kind of take it for granted a little bit at this point because they are consistently some of the absolute best displays on any phone seems like that's again what we're looking at here 6.8 inches corner to corner 1440p resolution 120 hertz max refresh rate and this is an ltpo2 display now so the refresh rate can modulate all the way down to one hertz when not much is happening for an even better mix of efficiency and responsiveness also i was able to turn on adaptive refresh rate mode and 1440p resolution at the same time so that's good you know we know it'll kill your battery but hey you pay for a lot of those pixels so you might as well be able to use them all but yeah this appears to be the world-class display we expect again the selfie camera cutout is still top center not taking too many risks by putting it underneath the display and the ultrasonic fingerprint reader is still in the same spot same size and you've got that little curve on each side of the screen the smaller s22s are completely flat and i prefer that this one curves over the edges a little bit into the side rails just like the other notes you can see the little ultra wide band cut out on the rail under the power and volume buttons and then of course the biggest new feature of the s22 ultra is a feature that came from the old notes which is the built-in stylus the s pen like i said it's a note so the beloved built-in stylus returns to the bottom corner of the phone pops in and out,186.08,621.843,181.28
Marques Brownlee,ldadR6XqiWE,Phone,Samsung,reversibly it has all the software the screen off notes the super low latency everything that people loved about the s pen before it's all still here and it's also funny this year the s pens are all black no matter what color phone you get but just the cap of the pen will match the color of the rails which also matches the color of the camera rings it really feels like this phone just picks up right where the old notes left off because other than the name basically does exactly that also you might have noticed i haven't even gotten to the specs yet but they're exactly what you'd expect as a spec bump from those older notes snapdragon 8 gen 1 chip and it's gonna have the exynos versions in certain regions again but it's a new four nanometer chip and then every spec other than the baseline version has 12 gigs of ram so it'll start at eight but then every single other one up to one terabyte of storage will have 12 gigs of ram so you can spec it up to that high sounds expensive but you can go that high if you want to the battery stays at the 5 000 milliamp hours which is impressive given there is now a cutout inside for the s pen and there's 45 watt fast charging in the ultra and the s22 plus but not in the regular no charger in the box but it'll support that fast charging if you give it enough juice that's like 50 charge added in 20 minutes of being plugged in and these cameras are interesting they're not bumped up so much in the hardware department but there sure are a lot of new software features so you're still looking at quad cameras the 108 megapixel main camera the ultra wide a 3x telephoto and a 10x telephoto but,275.759,621.843,191.99999999999997
Marques Brownlee,ldadR6XqiWE,Phone,Samsung,then in the software there's a bunch of stuff there's a new nona binning mode for high resolution nighttime photography it'll combine the brightness of binned photos with the detail of the 108 megapixel mode there's an improved pro mode with new raw formats they're doing ai stereo depth mapping for better portrait mode photos and also just playing around with the extremely limited time i had with hands-on it feels like the 100x space zoom has even more improved stabilization that tries to kind of lock onto subjects presumably something contrast-based from what i can tell there's a lot of stuff i got to test on here especially in the camera department to see if it's actually better or more improved than last year but that should all be in the full review so for sure make sure you get subscribed to be among the first to see that full review when it does come out but yeah i think we're pretty much all on the same page i am very pumped to test long term the note 20 or s22 ultra and all of its new features let me know in the comment section below what you want to know about i mean there's a bunch of interesting stuff the battery of course is still huge maybe it's one ui 4.1 maybe it's the new camera features maybe it's the style of stuff let me know i'll be hanging out down there to figure it out and the full review will be coming up soon until then make sure you check out the s22 and s22 plus video if you're interested in those as well and that's basically it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],372.479,621.843,170.759
Marques Brownlee,vax8FCuQUsE,Phone,Samsung,hey what's up mkbhd here and these are samsung's new 2022 flagship smartphones and i'm saying it's these and not the ultra just because these will probably sell more volume and these are the phones more people will experience and i do have some thoughts for my first hands-on with them so the running theme i think you'll notice here is uh if it ain't broke don't fix it so they didn't they really did not change a whole lot about these there's a lot that's similar they played it safe but one of the biggest differences one of the most noticeable differences to me when i actually got to hold it and feel it in the hand is something that most people who buy it probably won't care about that much because everyone puts a case on their phone and that's the build quality so i have a video on the s22 ultra dropping at the exact same time as this one it'll be linked below if you want to watch that it's basically a galaxy note but these phones are a small update in every department from the s21 series across the board and like i said holding it in the hand for the first time the first thing i noticed is it's a bit more boxy a little more square on the sides a little more flat on the top and the bottom and just slightly tighter corner radii all the way around and the display is already flat on the front so it just feels a bit sharper overall and,2.56,621.843,137.76
Marques Brownlee,vax8FCuQUsE,Phone,Samsung,then on top of that the back is real glass this year instead of plastic like the s21 again not a huge deal for most people just putting a case on their phone but that is a step up in my opinion from the s21 and the s21 fv and it adds a little bit of weight too it's some density some heft to the feel of the phone everything else on the outside though mostly the same design same center camera cut out that i like so much same speaker and button placement same fingerprint reader placement still ip68 rated and at the front you're looking at essentially the same display as last year but slightly better and slightly smaller so still two different sizes of course the s22 plus is 6.6 inches and this might sound weird to say but because of how small the bezels are the s22 at 6.1 inches feels kind of compact now i'm doing air quotes like this isn't this clearly isn't a small phone but the new boxer shape and just the way it feels with the smaller bezels and the tighter corners it's it has a nice density to it just feels like a good compact sort of phone the update with this display though is it is now a much more variable refresh rate than last year so instead of just being 60 or 120 hertz this goes from 10 all the way up to 120 hertz now interestingly i'm told from samsung it is still not ltpo that's,71.36,621.843,155.038
Marques Brownlee,vax8FCuQUsE,Phone,Samsung,for the s22 ultra only so we'll see if this new display is a more efficient or not this is of course just the first look though it's not the full review so we'll have to see if that pans out as i actually get to use the phone by the way if you enjoy these quick first looks these short first impressions videos then there's a really good chance you'll enjoy this video's sponsor morning brew so of course i'm trying to keep you all up to date with these videos but morningbrew is a free daily newsletter that gets delivered right to your inbox that keeps you up to speed on the tech and finance and business world in a quick five-minute read so you'll for sure hear about new phones like this getting announced on morning brew but you also hear about the company behind it and the dynamics of the competition and all the other biggest stories in the industry for sure and it's not the normal like boring dry news language it's actually pretty funny and witty and informative at the same time so if you're interested in business finance or tech like i am it's completely free and it takes 15 seconds to subscribe you can go to morningbrew.com mkbhd and then you're in there so okay s22 and s22 plus are clearly pretty similar to the s21s from last year a little bit smaller and boxier but generally the same form factors with a spec bump so the new,148.879,621.843,138.96099999999996
Marques Brownlee,vax8FCuQUsE,Phone,Samsung,specs are a snapdragon 8 gen 1 or a new 4 nanometer exynos chip in some regions and all specs have eight gigs of ram with either 128 or 256 gigs of storage again that's it and then the new cameras are also a spec bump there's a new triple camera layout 50 megapixel main camera that's probably binning to 12 and a half megapixels then an ultra wide and a 3x telephoto camera the big change is that the high resolution camera is the main camera not the telephoto so you might remember last year when shooting 8k video you had to crop into the telephoto this time for shooting 8k video it can use the main camera which is going to have that wider normal field of view smaller detail for some but that's a big improvement for me then the other one thing to note is since the phones did get a bit smaller the batteries also did get smaller from last year the plus goes from 4 800 to 4 500 milliamp hours and the s22 goes from 4 000 to 3 700 milliamp hours that's really interesting i mean the camera bumps aren't noticeably bigger i don't know if the glass is much thicker than the plastic used to be so i'm not really sure of the reason but whatever it is you know an eight percent smaller battery something like that is something to keep an eye on for sure even if the display is a bit more efficient we'll have to test that but that's it as far,218.239,621.843,149.281
Marques Brownlee,vax8FCuQUsE,Phone,Samsung,as spec upgrades from last year like i said not a super long list but if you're interested in these phones which you really want to know is the difference between the s22 and s22 plus so here is the entire official list first of all they're different size phones so the same resolution display 1080p but of course a 6.6 inch larger one on the s22 plus and then the plus supports a faster 45 watt charging while the s22 only supports 25 watts no charger in the box for either of them but that's good to know and the plus has ultra wide band and wi-fi 6e support while the s22 doesn't just has normal wi-fi 6 and then larger battery in the bigger phone 4 500 milliamp hours over 3700 s22 plus 999 s22 7.99 so yeah let me know what you want to see in a full review of these phones once i actually get more than an hour to play with them i think one ui 4.1 is one of the interesting things about this phone obviously i saw there's a new messages app a default that appears to look just like the google messages app i want to look more into that but if you have questions about the battery life that could be concerned the displays let me know in the comments section i'll hang out there that'll inform the full review get subscribed to see it make sure you hit that red button if you haven't already alright that's it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],293.36,621.843,163.49800000000005
Unbox Therapy,5TdLgC1KyTI,Phone,Apple,so I'm sure you've heard the reports at this point the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max went on sale a little less than a week ago and the first owners of the device some of them at least are complaining that the device can get too hot during usage while charging sales of Apple's latest iPhone 15 Pro are heating up and so reportedly are the actual devices it's the Wall Street Journal reporting that some folks are talking about phones that reach 122° yeah some people are suggesting that the iPhone 15 Pro Design is in some way flawed the speculation that I've seen is that it's something in the construction of the phone these are titanium phones titanium does not allow the release of heat from the phone like other materials do so that appears to be one of the issues a speculation and accusation at the moment I want to get to the bottom of it and see if it's even true at all I haven't noticed this I haven't tested for it I've kind of read a couple of Articles I've also seen on Twitter users reporting that their devices are going above 100 fahit and in some cases the charge would stop at 80% it's just heating up too much in an attempt to get to the bottom of this I have done a few things so for one I've got the thermal imaging camera so we can get some good data as far as how hot these phones are getting and then I've also gone out and gotten an iPhone 14 pro Max in this box here this is sealed still at the moment and you probably think that's crazy well it is kind of crazy but I wanted good data here cuz this is a big issue I want to find out if it's actually happening sometimes when the phone is brand new it can heat up a little bit more than it will eventually like shortly after setup there's one more speculation that we're going to address as well which is maybe the overheating is software Associated maybe it's because of iOS 17.0.2 so in order to combat that we've got 17.0.2 installed on another iPhone 14 pro Max could it be software could it be Hardware could it be the latest generation of devices could it be Pro devices versus non-pro would you look at this this is the plus model device with an aluminum frame and we all know those of us that are technology fans that aluminum is incredibly capable when it comes to heat dissipation is it Superior to things like Titanium or even the stainless steel from the previous PR Max version there are so many speculations at the moment couple of headlines iPhone 15 Pro overheating concerns highlighted in two more reports courtesy of Mac Rumors Apple's iPhone Pro draws overheating complaints Insider Forbes Apple iPhone 15 Pro overheating reports and then 9 to5 Mac iPhone 15 Pro Design once again blame for causing overheating problems in this package here we have the new 15 Pro Max Blue titanium all we did is run down the battery to zero in this package let's go ahead and unseal it so you can see it's a brand new phone probably been sitting on the shelf for a while but we'll see what percentage of its 80% battery life it has retained,0.04,621.843,358.2380000000001
Unbox Therapy,5TdLgC1KyTI,Phone,Apple,while sitting on the Shelf oh so this one has way too much battery power let's go ahead and run this one all the way down so it's a completely Fair test look at this beautiful setup we have all the devices in front of me now and I've added a couple more in order to spice things up and just get a better idea of the landscape of these devices like the entirety an iPhone 15 regular running iOS 17 15 plus iOS 17 the pro Max which is at the center of this controversy overheat well whether it exists or doesn't exist this is an existing 14 pro Max that was in the studio that had also been updated to iOS 17 and that's interesting because beside it is the new out of thebox 14 pro Max on iOS 16 has not been updated yet so we can see if software is playing a role when you have two identical pieces of hardware and then just for fun on the very end we have the device that I'm currently using the s23 ultra over here we have identical power power bricks actually we've got a lot of power bricks courtesy of our friends over at ankor you guys know that's our charging partner they make a charger for everyone regardless of what you want if you want the ultra portable this is the new Nano Pro so we'll do the 20 W test first and then we'll move over to the more substantial fast Chargers this a 65 wat capable so we'll see if the higher powered Chargers create more heat create more of a problem the key to this test is right here this of course is the thermal imaging camera so we will be checking each of these devices at different intervals to see where exactly they're heating up on the device and the last thing to mention these are all dead dead like completely dead because we want to go from zero 15 plus dead dead 15 Pro Max completely dead 14 pro Max iOS 17 also very dead iOS 16 on the 14 pro Max brand new out of the box dead and s23 Ultra they're all dead and by the way if you want to kill a battery quickly just shoot the highest resolution video and let it run baby will heat up I also have two different temperature gauges we'll use this one for the preliminary and then we'll get the infrared images to see where the devices are heating up as well and then we've also got a timer here we're going to check in at different intervals now keep in mind there's other variables like the temperature of the room so the ambient temperature here table temp 71.2 phone temp 71.2 cuz these things are dead actually a little cooler than that But ultimately the room is pretty cool so any finding we have here you can obviously imagine that if it was warmer in the environment then we would reach these temperatures sooner I'm going to have to plug them in quickly 1 2 3 4 five and six wo let's go ahead and start the timer little Heat going right away can just tell from the touch I'm not going to check until the 5 minute Mark though so I want to let them establish a charge a reminder we're coming off of a 20 W power brick at this point we will get our measurements and then we'll increase the charge rate to see if those,179.239,621.843,383.9240000000001
Unbox Therapy,5TdLgC1KyTI,Phone,Apple,measurements change and by how much okay we are approaching the 5minute Mark here let's start on this side Oo we are up for sure 82 and 1/2 83 84 move over to the 15 plus round this same 15 Pro Max iOS 17 a little cooler I found a hot spot not quite 83 yet H 14 pro Max on iOS 17 up over 84 83.4 83.6 very similar and the Samsung is cooler it has not cracked still didn't crack 80 though 797 the s23 ultra is the coolest iPhones are almost all the same temperature at this point now keep in mind those early reports seem to indicate that it was later on in the charge cycle that things started to heat up I think it was around the 80% Mark so this might not be all that significant right now but let's go ahead and reach for the thermal device and see where these are getting hot so we're approaching 15 minutes now or 14 minutes you can see the portions of the device that are hot tend towards the right side if you're looking from from the back and we can look for our brightest spot to sort of see our Peak temperature on each 83 right around 83 it looks like 15 plus maybe slightly less heat bigger body more ability to dissipate more aluminum I mean we're talking about like 1° get over to the pro Max 81.2 close 81 oh 81.5 M the iOS 16 and 17 device are very similar here and the Samsung it looks to be mostly high 70s still approach in 80 but the majority of it tends to stay underneath 80 you can see just how much warmer the iPhone is top to bottom compared to the Samsung like that by how bright that glow happens to be you know what it's nothing crazy going on right now like these are they warm sure they're warm not uncomfortably hot let's check the battery life here real quick so 26% charged 15 Pro Max 15 plus 28% charged 32% charged on the 15 so like we're getting close to that halfway charged point and these things haven't really cracked 90° F we'll check in one more time and then we'll switch the Chargers out for the 65 W models and see if that makes a difference 30 minute Mark 90 oh keep going 93 93 a lot of this is depends on the spot that you're pinpointing but I'm going to basically be looking for hot spots here 93 33 was the hottest I got on this device 93 so they're very comparable at this point 15 Pro Max is border line 93 as well although it is a little bit cooler very comparable 14 pro Max ooh a little hotter I saw it breach 94 yeah there we go 942 iOS 17 iOS 16 942 almost identical and Samsung coming in at 855 886 the iPhones are are basically hot everywhere but the camera section at the moment and the Samsung is a more subtle yellow it's not quite as bright but it looks to be fairly evenly distributed across the back of the device this guy is 83 and this one is 93 like that 10° difference Fahrenheit quite substantial when you're holding it this one feels hot whereas to me this one feels kind of normal I would barely describe it as warm I mean it's obviously warmer than the ambient temperature but not in a noticeable way where this I'd say oh yeah I'm holding,373.0,621.843,459.99999999999994
Unbox Therapy,5TdLgC1KyTI,Phone,Apple,that's a hot phone that phone's heating up so that 10° F difference is noticeable is it doing any kind of damage is it incredibly dangerous no at this point it really hasn't impacted anything let's check our charge rates here 61% 49% bigger battery obviously 49% 53% interesting 53% of the 14s a little quicker and the s23 41% so we've been charging now for 35 minutes what do you say we step it up a notch here and go to the more powerful bricks whether that makes a difference or not we'll find out so I'm just going to hit the power switch here now each one of these Chargers is a 65 wat capable the one on the very far end is a 100 W capable charger the 100 watt I will reserve for the Samsung device throw even more power at it and see if we can get it to heat up plugged in and ready to go they had a moment of rest there now let's go ahead and flip the switch and they are coming off the bigger power Bricks now we'll give that about 5 minutes and see if things change looks like the heat has actually gone down a little bit much hotter over here uh the 15 plus is above 95 95 a half was the high there 15 Pro Max ooh that's our new high is the 14 pro Max on iOS 17 reached 96.4 96.6 14 pro Max on iOS 16 92.6 and the s23 ultra ooh we're finally heating up on the 100 wat charger we're into the 9394 this one must be flying now and that's warm now and we're at 58% 15 Pro Max 63% now it's a race to the Finish Line obviously battery sizes are different will we crack 100 and if so at what what moment it was weird that the standard model really cooled off iPhone 15 standard like really cooled off it's not a massive difference so it's not like in one case we're reading 100 and then the other phone is like 80 they're all pretty close maybe with the exception of the standard 15 now which seems to measure for some reason below 90 like 88.8 and then the others are towards 95 at the moment let's give it 10 more minutes give it 10 more minutes 56 minutes of charging quite a bit of charging down even more this one has cooled right off iPhone 15 iOS 17 down to 83.8 at the high and 76% charged 15 plus also cooled off a little bit 89° F 88.8 sitting at 79% charged 15 Pro Max equally cooled off 88.7 88.3 88 not even 88 87.8 76% charged ooh 14 pro Max stays above 90 but barely 79% charged 14 pro Max on iOS 16 88.8 75% charged s23 Ultra now the hottest at 94.4 84% charged well obviously the s23 ultra is taking more power at the moment and recharging faster so that's the reason we're getting more heat here but we still haven't cracked 100 so I think an hour to this we have to step things up a little bit and to see how they work at the extremities we'll open the camera application 4K 60 and we will begin recording camera video 4K 60 record camera video 4K 60 record all right so they're all recording now and recharging taking as much power as they possibly,603.16,621.843,454.23900000000003
Unbox Therapy,5TdLgC1KyTI,Phone,Apple,can now they should heat up even more because they're functioning and faster charging I think we'll be able to crack 100 here well let's give it about 5 minutes 1 hour and 7 minutes and the devices are now running application in the background and it's a hefty application oh baby 106.1 was the high here we go 106 107 so you can see here we're up to 107.7 on the iPhone 15 now the 15 plus cools itself off a little better in this terrible scenario 10 4 bigger surface area just ever so slightly better than the iPhone 15 Pro Max coming in 1049 105 still not as hot as the first phone 14 pro Max on iOS 17 cooler wait climbing pretty fast not that much cooler 104 you know 105 106 and obviously the s23 ultra not quite as Hot 100 on the dot they're all up over 100 now what does that feel like to hold that feels burning hot that obviously is burning hot in your hand it is quite uncomfortably hot what is the finding any phone can get hot big time and these have continued to get thinner and lighter charge faster shoot higher resolution video and given a certain combination of stressors pretty much all of them can crack a 100 should it happen when you're just recharging the device probably not it's you know it's difficult for me to validate some of those findings there's so many variables at play like what kind of applications possibly running in the background what is the ambient temperature what is the charger that you're using how much optimization is the phone doing at that particular moment is it brand new or have you used it a bunch such a wide variety of variables and models and I didn't find anything all that out of the ordinary but do I think it's a design flaw do I think there are Corners being cut probably not based on this finding here there might be some devices that are defective that are heating up more easily that have some sort of an issue that's always possibility but my samples in front of me are all extremely comparable we went up to 110.4 here we're still going up1 I think what might be happening in some of these circumstances the person has preheated the phone sounds like we're doing baking here but like was playing games or shot a bunch of video and then immediately plugged it in then the fast charge kicked in so then it was a combination effect but as you can see it's not exclusive to the 15 Pro Max hopefully you can gather some insight from it and hopefully you can go support our sponsor as well over at anchor pick up a little power brick whether it be a 20 wat or maybe you want the 65 I'm a big fan of this unit here for me it's not even that much bigger and has the flip down prong so it's even more portable and then you're going to use it for your Ultra Book one charger to rule them all anyways lots of nice options over there if you found this to be useful in any way go ahead and leave a thumbs up down below leave a comment do you feel that it's heating up too much and if so what series of events causes yours to reach these steaming hot temperatures above 100° fah thanks for watching later guys,834.079,621.843,370.40100000000007
Unbox Therapy,G5QdOWHkkBU,Phone,Apple,finally got the new iPhones iPhone 15 iPhone 15 plus iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now the color selection I have in here it was deliberate not necessarily my first choices but ones that I thought would be good to take a look at and compare first up we had to get one in the natural titanium this is a 15 Pro and natural titanium and it's actually a one terabyte version which is complete Overkill if you saw my how not to order an iPhone 15 video I think for most people one terabyte is kind of uh probably diminishing returns when you consider the cost but this was the only natural titanium I could get when I ordered it and I definitely wanted to show off a natural titanium so that's the spec on that one and by the way these like last I checked delivery times had slipped into October and for the pro Mac natural titanium into November so apparently this is a very hot color that people are interested in next up for the regular iPhone 15. now you guys remember from my how not to order the iPhone 15 video I said that for the standard 15 Baseline model I would personally be interested in the blue so that's what we have here they just call it blue it's like that very very light blue color so we'll check that out we've also got a yellow I was the most skeptical of I said I would not order the yellow for myself personally but because of that I wanted to get one for this unboxing video to see does it truly look as bad as I think it might I mean it is the palest Demis yellow that I don't even and then last is another interesting color the blue titanium a new color which kind of looked like the darker titanium colors in general like this one has a little bit of a blue tone to it so it could be interesting that gives us one of each model 15 Pro 15 regular 15 plus and of course 15 Pro Max unboxing experience similar these things have just continued to get more and more slender there's less and less inside the package and that's not exclusive to Apple that's for all smartphone brands that have now stopped including a ton of extras two little pull tabs this is extremely frustration free no blade even necessary here's our first Glimpse at the natural titanium okay for sure this phone got lighter I can just tell I handled this device often enough to know that you know it feels lighter in the hand we have the brushed titanium look it's already Gathering some fingerprints there apparently this is more of an issue on the darker colors we'll do our testing over there as well but yeah you're gonna tarnish it a little bit it's titanium hopefully Mo can pick that up there it does gather fingerprints immediately on the titanium frame but titanium is such a cool material when they say natural titanium it kind of messed with your mind a little bit or at least it did for me because sometimes I'm ordering clothes like a natural hoodie or something and it actually has like a beige tone to it when you think of natural but they're just meaning here like this is the color of titanium it looks like a brushed kind of Steel color so camera module cut out power switch over here volume up and down and then obviously the new action button look at this this is so strange to see on an iPhone for the first time USBC on the bottom of the device no more lightning connector we've also got speakers in that location as well inside the package not a ton I think we're going to get some stickers a white Apple sticker not a natural titanium sticker a Sim tool a little bit more paperwork and then a braided USBC to C cable it's white it's not any type of like special color to go with the natural titanium no more power adapter included in the box and you might be thinking about what your options are for that our partners at anchor have plenty of solutions for you including this little guy this is a 20 watt power brick which is the same size as Apple's existing 5 watt power brick look at this they're I mean basically the same size either is pocketable and,0.079,621.843,464.2010000000003
Unbox Therapy,G5QdOWHkkBU,Phone,Apple,one is 20 and the other is five now Apple also sells their very own 20 watt adapter but that gets quite a bit larger and actually more expensive than anker's variant but Anker has a bunch of other products too including their very own high powered type c cables to match the aesthetic and then there's some new power Banks they just put out also this nano power bank is capable of 30 watt recharge I like the fact that you can kind of hang this one you've also got a USB a and another USBC there's another little power bank option here which plugs in just like this sits on the bottom 22.5 watt capable nano power bank USBC connection for iPhone now and not just Android devices you can use this for all your different devices including your other iOS devices that were already on USBC now what about when you're at home or traveling maybe on the desktop or even on the bedside table check out how slim this little power cable is power strip they've actually designed it so that the receptacle extends to receive the entirety of the power brick USBC USB a another usba and then one more type c so lots of Versatility here this is called the six in One charging station and it's 67 watt capable now I know most people have moved on from this 5 watt brick but there's still out there I still see people recharging their modern smartphone with a USB a 5 watt Apple power brake believe it or not if you are committed to this form factor and you want something extremely small then that's where the Nano Pro comes in you can have that but still get the 20 watts that your device can take advantage of so what we'll do is unbox two of these phones we'll plug one into the 5 watt adapter and one into the 20 watt adapter just to Showcase how big of a difference that is you can go check the description for pricing you're also going to save money on this right now to go with your new iPhone so go click those links and pick up a nano Pro from Anker for faster charging in a similar little form factor all right next up let's reach for the iPhone 15 blue and this is actually the base model and so therefore it is the most affordable iPhone 15 at the moment I'm having a hard time figuring out what to recommend to people I was actually just having a conversation with the viewer of the channel randomly in public that's even lighter than I thought it was going to be and he said what should I get should I get the iPhone 15 what do you think do I need the pro and then he was going over his finances with me and I was like well hard to say these are all expensive of devices I think bang for your buck for somebody in that boat for somebody who is concerned about the upgrade costs coming from a much older iPhone very reluctant to upgrade probably the 15 is sufficient the other thing I should mention speaking of light weight these have gotten a lot closer now because of the titanium aspect the titanium construction on the pro model the blue is more prominent in the frame rather than the actual back plate really dims the bluishness and instead it almost looks white I don't mind it it's just extremely light keep that in mind so in the hand we're talking about an extremely comparable user experience we've got USBC joining the party on the standard iPhone 15 as well we've got a slightly different placement for the SIM tray we have our separate volume buttons and no action button instead you maintain your switch which I don't know for some people that might be a preference they may prefer the existing switch we've got our power switch over on the other side and the camera hump not as significant still got plenty of wobble there slightly less maybe do we have blue stickers nope just going to get a white sticker they simplified all right next up we have the controversial yellow I believe in my last iphone 15 video I think I referred to this as urine colored iPhone yellow I don't know gotta wait and see things can sometimes appear differently I wasn't the only one a lot,233.28,621.843,450.96000000000004
Unbox Therapy,G5QdOWHkkBU,Phone,Apple,of people were saying hey these colors are extremely subdued this year nothing is very vibrant kind of pale yeah hahaha that is a weird that is weird like how you have I don't know if this is showing up for you Mo but there's nothing pleasing about this color to me at all it's a barely there yellow a reasonably hydrated urine which increases in its Amber tone when you get to the camera I don't know who wants this color the frame I don't mind it's kind of more of like a light gold but like the actual phone itself that is a a rather odd Choice from Apple the same otherwise compared to the non-plus model we've still got our USBC here we've got our switch which remains intact obviously battery sizes display sizes are going to be different if you guys are curious about the e-sim thing here in Canada we're still having the SIM tray even though these devices are simultaneously esim compatible or capable however in some markets they could be esim only so this is the granddaddy the pro Max and this is in blue titanium and it is the base model 256 storage base for the Promax the base for the standard phone is 128. I think this is a beautiful color this is a very nice color this one is better in real life than in the images it is a very very deep blue almost towards black with the mirrored blue finish up in the camera section here and the matte finish everywhere else from a fingerprint perspective also a bit of a magnet because of that titanium aspect I don't know for me my initial reaction is so what it's titanium that's so cool like a titanium phone like just the attributes of titanium are so cool and lighter definitely which makes a bigger difference on a bigger phone you know if you were sort of borderline if you wanted a Max device now it's a little bit lighter it's a little bit less of a brick in my pocket pretty cool so check this out these are now set up and the first thing that you are prompted by on the pro and pro Max model is to configure your action button press and hold to turn silent mode on and off you can also customize the action button to open camera turn on flashlight or access a favorite iPhone feature okay so let me click customize we'll see what some of the options are silent mode yeah we know about that Focus so do not disturb that's nice straight into the camera flashlight voice memo magnifier a shortcut to an app for now for the purpose of demonstration we'll do flashlight here we go that's a that's an action button flashlight press and hold it's off press and hold it's on press and hold its off I can see this being useful I mean look I like buttons I like switches I like versatility I like the fact that it doesn't have to be something by default but instead it's encouraging you to configure it and they even built that little initial interface in order to encourage you to do so this display is bright that is a very nice looking display on the pro Max let's boost the brightness on the standard Pro also extremely bright let's do a quick display comparison while we're here yeah more pop on the pro have you not seen that yet what was it you haven't seen this yet no no you don't blow on it you just tap them like that to exchange contacts nearby share have you seen that before yeah it's subtle but this display is a slight step slight Step Above let's go to the regular 15. this display looks better than the regular Pro it looks better than the plus it looks better than the standard iPhone 15 subtle they all look good so let's test the speakers let's start with regular iPhone 15 audio test full volume [Music] foreign 15 plus [Music] iPhone 15.,459.12,621.843,510.52000000000015
Unbox Therapy,G5QdOWHkkBU,Phone,Apple,[Music] 15 plus [Music] the plus has more bass yeah let's go to the pro [Music] foreign [Music] I would say and then last up Pro Max which should sound the best [Music] [Music] take away here the bigger phones just sound better there's obviously subtle differences beyond that I don't know maybe maybe the 15 plus might sound the best but it's very similar they're close cameras okay let's bring over our favorite plant within the pro lineup the max model gives you the advantage of having more reach on the zoom lens what that means for you is five times Optical I'll go in order of short to Long here is 0.5 x followed by 1X which they're calling 24 millimeter 2x which they don't bother representing in millimeter form and then 5X damn that 5x is nice very beautiful bokeh like in the background so this is exclusive to the pro Max model if you really want that extra reach and this is where you're going to be looking if I load up the standard pro model the layout is identical except in this situation the furthest reaches 3x so 0.5 1 two and three so to get an idea of the difference in reach that's what 3x is going to give you that's what 5x is going to give you so quite different but I don't know at a sporting event or something you could take advantage of 5x a concert I don't need to tell you these these cameras are great performers and now we have this new 5x Zoom which is one of the better Optical zooms I've seen Now we move over to the standard iPhone 15. our options once again are different we go from 0.5 to 1 and then to 2X and we end there it's kind of funny you go up the the list here and you get closer and closer the more money you spend the closer you get to your subject standard model 0.5 one two they all look great we're talking about cameras on smartphones in 2023 they do all have Dynamic Island it's a tried and true form there's people watching this video that are sitting there saying it's not different enough I agree like it's there's nothing shocking about it it's iterative I said this in previous videos hey you put a little button over here you throw an action button on there you're changing material to Titanium how big of a deal is that to the general public most of the conversations I'm having in public it's not that big of a deal you asked Tim Cook he'll be telling you these are the best iPhones we've ever made as they should be they're the most recent version but how much better than the previous version for me this this is going to sound crazy but for me the most compelling new feature is USBC and that's kind of sad it just took too long oh but seriously like I just hated having to have separate cables even separate cables within Apple's ecosystem I was ready for that to be done and now that we have type c here this feels to me like a modern 2023 device the other thing I should mention one of my favorite aspects of iPhones in general is the video modes these are some of the best video Shooters out there period it has an incredibly smooth and pleasing smartphone video capability 4K here 4K 60. look at the bokeh look at the Focus fall off look at the 60 frames look at the smoothness and I'm gonna move around this plant look how smooth this camera move is and of course the audio that you're hearing is coming via the microphones on the device as well so you get a sense for the performance there and I will do my usual and approach Mo in an uncomfortable way so that you can see how it focuses on a human face but then I'll hold it longer than I should oh no so then he gets more,728.83,621.843,498.3289999999999
Unbox Therapy,G5QdOWHkkBU,Phone,Apple,uncomfortable and we get a we get the retention Spike that we're looking for okay the camera's really good look man like the camera is really good the camera's really good because I've been shooting videos for so long I had a video camera back in the day before anybody had video cameras like before smartphones even shot video think about that for a second couple of gray hairs in the beard over here the fact that we can shoot that caliber of video on this little guy is just a bit ridiculous honestly how different is it going to be if I'm saving some cash and grabbing the iPhone 15 regular 4K 60. iPhone 15 regular test smooth 1X audio coming through the microphone spin tomorrow is it 4K oh it's 4K okay okay that looks great as well man for for the average person it looks great as well this one's Gathering more fingerprints by the way as I'm using it you know what these fingerprints don't matter to me because I know I'm gonna slap a later case on here anyways just like that boom and just like that my titanium is mostly protected and covered and I'll just be holding on to this beautiful Kevlar instead without adding a tremendous amount of weight or bulk and yes we are taking orders for 15 pro pro Max 15 regular 15 plus so head over to the link in the description if you want to pick up a later case for yourself this is for people who want the absolute thinnest case possible extremely satisfying texture and extremely easy on and off capabilities satisfying in every way so how much are you really missing out on if you're still letting this live watt power adapter kick around well you're missing out on like over an hour's worth of savings recharging your device and we actually stacked the deck against anchors 20 watt in this case by having it recharge the bigger Pro Max model which obviously has a bigger battery to charge versus the 5 watt which only had to recharge the regular Pro 15 Pro so the pro Max charging off of the 20 watt nanopro power adapter that's two hours and 20 minutes from dead complete dead zero all the way to a hundred percent and the old school 5 watt power adapter took three hours and 40 minutes to charge up the iPhone 15 Pro from zero Dead all the way to full It's Time to Say Goodbye to these little units and replace them with far better units like the this one 20 watts versus 5 Watts it's an absolute no-brainer all right so there you have it iPhone 15 15 Pro 15 plus 15 Pro Max is it a revolutionary iPhone not really I told you my favorite feature is kind of a mundane one which is just USB type-c I like the material I like this idea of titanium I do like having this configurable action button I love the fact that Apple left it configurable I think my optimal device out of the bunch is probably the 15 Pro regular size I also think the 15 is probably a good value for a lot of people comparatively if you're in the Apple ecosystem if you're sticking with iPhone I don't think you have to have the pro model the standard model has gotten really good yes you're giving up some features and functionality but for a lot of people I talk to in public this thing is going to be a huge upgrade over what they currently have in their pocket the fit and finish is really nice it's well put together the colors leave something to be desired they're not super Punchy they're more subdued this year but who knows maybe some people will prefer that let me know down in the comments which model you're most interested in if you're gonna buy one at all or if there's some other smartphone that you have your eye on also make sure to go support our sponsors anchor and also of course later case if you want to slap an incredibly slim case on your brand new iPhone 15 15 Pro 15 Pro Max 15 plus or other smartphone thank you very much for your time foreign,1000.019,621.843,513.5020000000001
Unbox Therapy,9ZKKix2Tbcc,Phone,Apple,so the iPhone 15 just came out you are going to be receiving yours very soon or maybe you're thinking about buying one in the coming days so you're probably thinking about cases so I went out and picked up all the new options I decided to get the pro Max variant for these cases but of course this will apply to any iPhone 15 that you end up purchasing I want to get to the bottom of which is the best of the Apple cases also with a separate mention for later case as an option the iPhone 15 Pro Max Fine woven case that is a new style for Apple obviously as the name implies it's going to have a little woven texture it also coincides with their new woven wallet which will be a special mention and we'll see how that interacts with all these different cases because it's magsafe compatible does it work better with the woven case as opposed to the clear case or the silicone case now the pricing here is different I have Canadian prices in front of me the wall is kind of expensive 79 the line woven case also 79 clear case 69 and the silicone case the same price there so the woven has a price premium so it will have to be better in order to justify the extra 10 bucks so let's go ahead and actually start with the fine woven case I will select my favorite and I also want you guys to do the same let me know down in the comments hello what there's got to be a seal somewhere but I don't think so a little less smooth than usual for Apple honestly so I also want you guys to let me know in the comments section which of these you would choose are you leaning towards the woven the clear case or the silicone case so this is fine woven case it almost it has like a little Mark on it already right there a little Dent it is extremely fine woven actually I do like that texture it's much less like a linen type fiber and almost silky to the touch I think that's going to be satisfying for people I do question the long-term durability of it and maybe I will give it a couple of little scratches here's what it sounds,0.0,621.843,252.90300000000002
Unbox Therapy,9ZKKix2Tbcc,Phone,Apple,like at the moment oh there you can see those scratches already showing up I'm curious this this is going to be one of those ones where over time whatever sort of patina it develops might be something people appreciate Apple no longer making a leather case which obviously does that as well on its own is it going to be a pleasing type of long-term look or is it just going to look ratty I don't know now this is a full coverage case of course with magsafe built in you obviously have your various button maps including your new action button because this is the pro Max variant the remainder of the frame not fine woven at all this is some sort of plasticky rubber like material it's not unpleasant this is a strange material this fine woven material is it one of these recycled products apple is saving the universe ah the fine woven case is made from luxurious micro twill with a soft yet durable suede like texture to protect your iPhone the material may show wear over time interact action with magsafe accessories will leave slight imprints now it doesn't say anything about it being recycled material or anything like that it's just micro twill so you're going to have to be okay with something that doesn't necessarily look or steam this is what it's going to look like on your device huge cutout well anytime I'm looking at the entire cut out like this it always looks huge to me now when I compare it to the cases that we make but you do have a frame there so when you place it down it will sit above those lenses it's kind of tough to see but the frame extends beyond the camera lenses so there will be some protection there if we reach for the woven wallet I think we're going to have a pretty seamless integration here and you know what's interesting to me it's so fine woven that it almost feels like leather to the touch it does not feel like a fabric the fibers are so fine it almost interprets it leather light you slap this on to the mag safe case and that thing it's pretty solid on there so the combination of the magsafe wallet fine,129.66,621.843,251.94000000000005
Unbox Therapy,9ZKKix2Tbcc,Phone,Apple,woven wallet with the fine woven case is that you're having a two-fold sort of grip to it you're getting the grip of the magnet initially which is strong here but then also the texture itself those fine little teeth sort of dig in a little bit and you get a much more solid in and out of the pocket we'll test the new magsafe wallet with the other cases as well to see if that varies so next up we have the 15 Pro Max clear case each one is a slightly different unboxing experience now this has been around for a while this is for somebody who wants kind of a more traditional case feel it's clear you can actually see the magsafe components in this case maybe that's something you like so we slap the phone this is Sleek like I like the feel of it slick though from a grip perspective you're not feeling quite as confident and let's try out the wallet here the wallet is on there but it's definitely not not gripping as the other thing remember with all clear cases is they do tarnish a little bit over time unlike maybe a pleasing patina that might occur with the woven and definitely occurs with leather this is probably just going to look uglier over time and obviously you're going to get Little Fibers and things that go underneath that you're going to see it will look really fresh at first protection wise I think they're going to be comparable the clear case is ten dollars less if that's significant to you now the last is maybe the most classic of all because Apple has been making silicone cases for a very long time and I should mention by the way the colors I chose here are all colors that I personally like and would use this one is called storm blue it's a nice dark blue but you can get this thing in like a hundred different colors we pull the seal here the silicone is our last option and these always feel super smooth when you first pull them out however in and out of the pocket they just pick up a little bit more in terms of fibers and they stick a little bit on the entry and on the exit this one is lacking any stick whatsoever so it could,255.12,621.843,235.319
Unbox Therapy,9ZKKix2Tbcc,Phone,Apple,still slip out of your pocket in like basketball shorts I've had this experience this one is going to grip a little in the pocket but it also means when you go to pull it out of your pocket it might stick too much I wonder where the woven fits in that regard woven pocket test a little bit of grip but coming out clean and let's try with the wallet attachment pocket coming out clean and this is a relatively loose fitting pocket this is probably not going to slide out unintentionally it's all about finding this optimal grip when we were thinking about the later case it was like okay how do you make something thin and light but then it can at least solve certain problems like for example unintended pocket slip the woven does achieve the same thing this guy the clear well it has no friction whatsoever look at that that baby is flying so that's worth noting and then last up the silicone that is the stickiest of the bunch so if you really don't want that thing to slide out of your pocket this is going to do it over the course of a Year's Worth or years worth of using these things you start to notice these small differences particularly somebody like myself that looks at a variety of different options in this regard I do like this color this storm blue is pretty cool if we slap this one onto the phone this goes on very easy it has that nice soft microfiber interior and that's what it looks like from the outside once again this lip goes up Beyond The Hammer section and this is the same price as the clear your version so the silicone will be a popular choice just because people are familiar with it and comfortable with it and they can get whatever color and style they choose now the last up I do want to just highlight because we do have the later case ready to go for the new phones and these just slap on super easy this is an option for a person that really prioritizes sleekness and thinness and appreciates a woven-like texture but in this case through using aramid Kevlar fibers this is available in a few different colors,373.259,621.843,219.65999999999997
Unbox Therapy,9ZKKix2Tbcc,Phone,Apple,actually funny enough I was thinking like as a woven substitute you go with this coffee color and you still get the Stick of the magsafe wallet on the back now how does this hold actually it holds pretty well and this is just strictly through thinness I didn't want to add any weight to the case later case gives you another option but this video is all about analyzing Apple's offerings of course we'll have links to all of these cases in the description whichever is most suitable to you I think out of this bunch I would probably go for the woven I don't think I'm gonna like the way that this age is it's gonna have an aged look to it maybe that's not something that bothers you like for example I'm a fan of leather and I don't mind so much that it shows a little bit of wear and tear on it but it's important for you to know if you're a person that like the smallest scuff bothers you I probably wouldn't go this way each one has its benefits and drawback I know this one sticks too much in my pocket that drives me crazy in shorts for example when you're in the car and you're trying to Wrangle it and get it out of there this one probably doesn't grip enough for me and I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of the clear aesthetic and the Hues and tones that are available in the new woven texture are kind of to my taste as well so for me it would be the fine woven for you I hope you'll let me know in the comments which of the bunch you would choose and also which color you would go for so I hope this little breakdown gave you a little bit more insight into what to expect with each of the case options coming from Apple for the upcoming iPhone 15. maybe it helped you make your choice and obviously that's important at this time because everybody getting these brand new phones and you probably want to protect it and this is not the easiest choice in some ways it's harder to pick a case than it is to pick a phone you may have already known for a long time I'm upgrading my phone I'm getting that next iPhone but then it's like wait a sec I didn't consider case at all but hopefully this highlighted the differences between Apple's selection,483.18,621.843,219.041

Unbox Therapy,MFbovYPi4UM,Phone,Apple,so the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro uh well it just got announced yesterday big Fanfare you know usual uh Apple event people get excited for for new iPhones I was talking to Moe about it we're watching we're like wow iPhone 15 15 times we've done this I mean it's changed a little bit as far as these Keynotes are concerned but 15 times anyway a lot of people are interested and want to know hey which one should I buy and which one should I not buy or at least which one is best for me what is the preference and so forth now I can't necessarily know like I don't know exactly what your needs are but I'm gonna go through the ordering process in order to determine some of the things I think are like a better value these are very expensive phones and of course we've seen all the memes people saying oh it's the same phone over again well listen it has USB type-c all right and that's already a big enough Improvement for me to get interested plus I like titanium titanium's cool look look I don't know you decide what you want to do with your own two grand or 1500 or whatever it is but let's go through the ordering process and find out what I like and what I think you should and shouldn't pay for so the first thing you're going to see obviously is the decision between the 15 Pro and the 15. now I'm just going to go out and say it I think for a lot of people the 15 represents the better value for money especially if you haven't upgraded in a while and you've been resistant because of cost so let's go ahead and first look at the pricing on the 15. pre-orders are starting at 5 a.m on 9 15. you'll be watching this video before that and then they'll ship on 922 so pricing on the iPhone 15 starts at 7.99 of course apple is also going to show you you can pay it off over a couple of years that's the number one thing I don't recommend you do don't don't don't pay it off over 24 months if they're writing years and months you know that they're probably trying to finesse you a little bit all right so just avoid that pay it up front if you can trade in your old model I'll get to that in a second because there's probably ways to actually get more money for your old model if you can skip out on some of the convenience so 15 or 15 plus 6.1 inch display versus 6.7 this is kind of a big gap this is a substantial difference in your pocket I think the regular size is going to actually be optimal for the majority of people unless you are looking for enhanced battery and a slightly better multimedia experience otherwise these things are fairly interchangeable so I'm going to say if you go 15 go Baseline get in,0.0,621.843,327.6589999999999
Unbox Therapy,MFbovYPi4UM,Phone,Apple,there for 799 bucks because you're looking for value for money and well if you were looking for value for money I don't know that you'd be looking at an iPhone but if you're looking for value for money in an iPhone then I think the Baseline iPhone 15 is kind of the way you want to go now the next step is what kind of color should we get if we are going for Baseline you know me I would likely go for black but that is way too boring of a selection so I'm gonna go for this nice new blue which is Almost White and kind of confusing it's going to look something like this right here for the do not buy things to avoid I'm probably going to pick the yellow sorry yellow I mean you're barely yellow anyways so I haven't even really even I don't know what what or who I could offend I'm not sure that anyone I've talked to is a huge fan of this color it's not really vibrant enough to even call itself yellow it's more like urine in fact if you're talking about like this is a relatively healthy urine because it's lacking pigment the dehydrated urine may have been a better color than this type this color of urine the green I don't mind either but for me I'm going to say go ahead and go for the blue or the black those would be my preferences now when it comes to storage this is a topic of conversation here in the studio we have our ongoing debates over what is the right amount of storage and then how much do you want to have in the cloud what are you actually doing on the phone are you storing a lot of video and multimedia because that can eat up your storage and then bandwidth I suppose if you're constantly uploading and so forth so maybe I mean this is kind of a cop-out but probably the middle ground is where you want to be spend 100 more get the 256 over the 128. the 512 I think gets a little crazy going up to 1100 bucks I don't think I'm gonna recommend Max storage in either of these at least for my personal usage I find it I I personally am satisfied with cloud-based storage for most things where I would run into storage issues is if I was using one of these for Content creation where the vast majority of the footage I shot would be on one of these phones then maybe we can talk about 512 in this case or even the one terabyte on the pro model but that's just not my workflow I use cameras for the majority of like production so the majority of footage is being offloaded and sitting on cards and drives and so on so it's not such a big deal but this is a very personal thing however I'll recommend the middle ground of 256. now let's talk about trade-ins because Apple does want,164.099,621.843,331.0020000000002
Unbox Therapy,MFbovYPi4UM,Phone,Apple,your trade-in however they don't want your trade-in if it isn't an existing iPhone I thought this was kind of funny as you look at the website here it's like oh you have an iPhone 14 pro Max you have an iPhone 14 pro that'll be up to 570. maybe you've only got an iPhone 8 will give you 60 bucks for it but you get to the very bottom and it says oh we have some other options we have some s22s we have some pixels they're like okay those have a little bit of value to us they have a OnePlus 10t for 70 bucks that's kind of strange addition but I like the one at the bottom other recycling not one of these we'll take care of that for you we'll Chuck it right in the bin I would say in most of these cases you can get more money for your device than what they're offering like the 14 pro Max for 650 talk about a drop off however this is a convenience thing so if I were to say head over to eBay iPhone 14 pro Max now obviously there's a lot of people selling these right now but you can see some of the pricing still I mean this one's got 80 this is 81 bids 810 bucks we head back over to Apple's site and you'll get the same model up to 650 and that auction was still going on so you're probably going to get closer to a thousand this is no kind of Revelation like you probably already know this but if you're all about convenience you could do your trade-in directly on their website now the other thing to keep in mind you get almost nothing in the box anymore other than the device and the charge cable now the nice thing this year is you are going to get a USBC charge cable which brings me to today's sponsor which is our great partner over at anchor who have such a variety of USBC accessories to take advantage of with your new iPhone 15. first off is this little guy this is the Nano pro charger and look how tiny that is this is about the same size as Apple's old 5 watt power adapter and it's providing 20 watts of power Apple's old form factor matching this which was like five watts of power charge faster for a cheap price and in something that basically fits into your pocket so this is a 5 000 milliamp hour power bank that just plugs into the bottom of your new USBC iPhone how sick is that 22.5 watt capable power bank so fast charging power bank so then you've got this in out port on the side so we can charge up the power bank itself or charge other devices via this port and the whole thing folds down so look how pocketable that nice little type c unit is of course this is cross-platform since we're USB type c we're now plugging in to our Samsungs and our pixels and well,332.52,621.843,338.3999999999999
Unbox Therapy,MFbovYPi4UM,Phone,Apple,even our iPads because they were already on type c maybe you want a little bit more power plus it seems like you can just hang it up look how genius the little design will you hang it off something don't you and then anchor has other stuff for nice little desktop charging stations you know about anchor they've got something for everyone and now even more so for iPhone users since we can say goodbye to the lightning stuff all right so let's talk about the pro model which is going to be it's going to be my iPhone of choice so I gave you like a little bit of criteria for purchasing the non-pro and sort of what I would do in that case but for me personally the way to order is to get the 15 Pro and the reason I say for me personally is because I put a huge emphasis on the camera components and using these things for shooting photos and shooting video and that's why I gotta go all the way to the pro Max this time around yes they're a little bit large not for everyone great for multimedia battery life has been pretty good on many recent generations of iPhone I expect the same thing to happen here we're up to 1200 bucks now to start and we're into this kind of scale right here 6.7 inches that'll be 50 bucks a month for two years again careful with the payment program over there you know if you only got 50 bucks in a bank right now don't buy a 1200 phone just an opinion I don't know just just saying put 50 put 50 50 bucks into Apple stock because they're going to sell a few things all right so the colors over here they're more subtle I don't know sophisticated I don't really know what you want to call them there's been a lot of talk about these options and how nothing is vibrant enough I don't know this one's actually easy for me and it's that's weird because I expected to just pick up the black titanium and call it a day but I'm gonna flip it I'm gonna flip it around I'm gonna flip it upside down I'm gonna go with natural titanium and the reason being is because we have this new material now and and this showcases the fact that it's that new material the best if you're if you appreciate Material Science and you love the attributes of titanium then I want to be reminded on a regular basis that my brand new fifteen hundred dollar phone is made of titanium like oh I paid for something it's glass it's titanium it still watches YouTube and I respond to messages on it it's,501.66,621.843,323.86
Unbox Therapy,MFbovYPi4UM,Phone,Apple,titanium and glass fifteen hundred dollars it matches your Ultra watch if your bow run around in circles around the office training for a marathon so I'm gonna go for the titanium natural titanium model I get to the storage here and honestly for me because everything is so cloud and I'm not shooting a feature film I can get away with the 256 in this regard I think 128 is cutting it way too tight but I can get away with 256 the safer bet is 512. that's 200 more bucks and then one terabyte takes it to sixteen hundred dollars which is just like all right you got to know that you want it I think a lot of people that will step up to that are just those that want to have the maximum spec and never have to worry about anything and this is back into the category of like is this a Production Tool for you I don't know how many people are living in that in that Universe where they're shooting prores on their iPhone 14 pro Max or upcoming 15 Pro Max but if you if you are shooting prores and raw then this is going to take up a lot more space and all of a sudden the storage conversation is going to get a little bit different this is not something that I do on the phone on a regular basis it's fun to play with from time to time but if you were doing it on a regular basis you would quickly run out of storage so that's another consideration so things to avoid I think maxing it out I would say maxing it out would be a thing to avoid I would say avoid buying Apple's first party Chargers I would say if you go with the iPhone 15 regular go for the base and just up the storage ever so slightly and maybe pick this cool new blue color and if you go for the 15 Pro maybe take the max for the added camera functionality with the extra reach on the zoom probably don't sell your old one to Apple if you can put up with the hassle of selling it privately and probably avoid that new yellow color iPhone 15 another year another iPhone is it necessary no don't feel left out these are small incremental improvements every year now when I sit and watch The Kino and I go oh here we are on number 15. what does it do it still does roughly the same things for a number of generations now with slight incremental improvements if you don't think you need an upgrade you probably don't and I don't think you should stress too much about not having the 2G sitting around or the one grand or whatever it happens to be these are just my opinions obviously you have to do you as you've heard the phrase you know you better than anyone else but those are just my takes that is my take and when this pre-order opens up I'll be ordering a natural titanium 15 Pro Max with 512 storage [Music],664.68,621.843,336.33

Unbox Therapy,82DgSYIfmcE,Phone,Apple,night and then maybe something a little bit warmer at a different point and since it's customized to you and your sleep cycles you get the right temperature for each sleep moment temperature is one of the most important factors in improving Your Sleep Quality when you wake up in the middle of the night or you feel extra groggy in the morning temperature is almost always to blame I personally am one of these hot sleepers I can never seem to get that right temperature that right cover but because with Aid sleep you can dial in the exact temperature that you're looking for it makes you feel cool without having to crank up the air conditioning and cool an entire house traditional mattresses they heat up throughout the night they trap heat inside and science has shown that your body temperature actually needs to drop in the early and middle stages of your sleep then it rises slowly in the morning so that you fall asleep fast and get more deep sleep you can have an individual setting for each side of the bed you can set an actual wake up time which will slowly Elevate the temperature but it'll even vibrate the mattress in order to give you that subtle calm wake up now the way this Tech works is through something that aidsleep calls The Hub this is where you're going to dump in your water which will then circulate through the Pod cover and then maintain that temperature that you desire so go ahead and and pick up your very own eight sleep pod cover using the link in the description we've even got a discount code for you unbox therapy all the details are down there now this next one might be the most polarizing it's kind of a strange one it's hard to say is it gold or cream or yellow it's another subtle tone now the frame definitely has a gold appearance,227.64,621.843,191.69999999999996
Unbox Therapy,82DgSYIfmcE,Phone,Apple,to it but this here yeah I don't really know what to call it do I like it I'm split maybe it will grow on me uh let's call it yellow for now but it probably won't grow on me I don't think maybe it's the combination of the gold and yellow maybe if it could have been a flatter surface in the frame but of course these are the material choices so that's unlikely let me know in the comments if you would go for that yellow now of course we have to have the classic white as well and it's going to be white and silver this one really makes the Apple logo pop with that mirror finish and then we get the silver aluminum frame around the outside this is for the minimalist this is for somebody looking for kind of the lightest seaming color as somebody who's looking for something that's the least tech-like this one is just as light as air let me know if you would choose the white model all right now let's move on to the pro lineup now these Pro devices I have in front of me these models obviously not representative of the max sizing I do have for scale a Max version so you can kind of see the difference there but that's okay because the color options are the same for now so here I'll go right to left and you'll notice differences right away so the accents on the Pro Models we've also got a polished look for the frame and for some of the elements around the camera section so that's a change obviously velocity versus Matte on the frame like these things have a kind of inverse effect obviously the dimensions are slightly different here as well and we've got an added camera this one makes the Apple logo far more subtle when unlike the mirror finish on the non-pro model here we just have a difference between the flat and the glossy below where it's,322.68,621.843,239.93999999999997
Unbox Therapy,82DgSYIfmcE,Phone,Apple,where you have the brushed Surface versus the non-brushed but that is it for light colors for Pro Models here we then move into our variety of grayish looks so this one is kind of the most familiar I guess the most truly gray and lacking pigment same thing as far as the layouts concerned where the glossy bits or the polished bits sort of pop out around the cameras now I like the color of the frame here it's dark but it's kind of it's got like almost like a subtle kind of pigment to it so it's not just black it's not quite black it's a nice accent to this particular gray tone and then we move into something that's more bluish but with the same frame coloring so this like midnight like blue here as you twist it but this has got to be black and this one still gets more blue this is very hard to distinguish between these and that's probably going to become a meme this is going to be a really hard choice for those that are looking for the darker colored pro model you might have to see it in store but anyway that I would say the biggest difference between these two models here is just the accent color for the polished portions because on this model here we have this I don't know seemingly purplish brownish tone whereas where we move up to the one that looks the most bluish then the frame gets even darker closer towards Indigo so some tough choices this year for iPhone upgrades and which color you choose and also I suppose which model you choose whether you go for the Baseline iPhone 15 or if you go all the way up to the pro Max let me know down in the comments which model which storage you're going to go for and then of course most importantly which color you would select out of these options for your next iPhone,443.34,621.843,244.72100000000006

Unbox Therapy,llUlJjEb4qs,Phone,Google,[Music] so you guys know I've been a fan of the pixel devices for a while and one of the main reasons that I've been such a fan is the way that the camera performs and the way that Google treats computational photography and increasingly video as well I got an opportunity to do a very unusual kind of camera test using the pixel 8 Pro and you're going to find out what that is as this video progresses but first let's talk a little bit about what makes the pixel 8 Pro camera special cameras special so in front of me I've got the three color options obviously we've got black which they call obsidian this bay blue which is kind of a nice tone of blue and then lastly the porcelain which has a kind of beige tone to it I'm going to go for the blue in this case now actually in my Hands-On video I didn't show you the unboxing experience so real quick this is how everything's packaged together I like the fact that we have this matte finish and then uh the glossy frame so most of it is fairly fingerprint resistant the device feels obviously very high quality the distinctive characteristic on all these pixel devices now is this camera bar which is different from the rest of the market which seems to slam the camera up into a corner or have some other protrusion one of the side benefits of that is that it you're typing if it's laying flat on a table so it doesn't wobble it's got a no wobble situation and I presume it also has some benefits for camera layout in general certainly when it comes to,0.68,621.843,174.20999999999998
Unbox Therapy,llUlJjEb4qs,Phone,Google,jamming in this five times optical zoom camera which as you'll find out later in this video is quite useful beyond the 5x because of the computational work that Google's capable of doing in order to produce usable images even beyond the optical zoom but 5x Optical is already great the other thing we've got here is a 48 megapix Ultra wide originally were kind of this thing that manufacturers overlooked or they put them in there but it wasn't a huge emphasis this time around around we've got an improvement in this area and Ultra wide cameras tend to be my favorites they're great for shooting architecture big groups of people things like this and just capturing more in the frame and then we've also got the 50 megapixel main camera which that's your best performer better lowlight performance F 1.65 aperture and then there's one more camera on the device as well that's on the front obviously this is a 10.5 megapixel also wider than you might find on other models and this just makes it easier to take those group shots as well so lots of considerations and changes in the camera department and then of course the software aspects that allow you to use Magic Eraser and Specialty things within the camera app that are exclusive to pixel so the only other items in the package type-c cable and then this little dongle USB c2a just for transferring your data over all right so what what does this mean for you obviously we're going to get our camera versatility here but of course you guys have seen the famous plant far too many,91.0,621.843,178.079
Unbox Therapy,llUlJjEb4qs,Phone,Google,times at this point so we had the opportunity to spice up this camera test and head somewhere [Music] unusual we are at scoa Bank Arena right now and they gave us a court we're on the court like we have the court right now and Mo's shooting on the pixel8 pro and Will's shooting on the pixel 8 and I've yet to make a a three-point shot but I'm going to before I leave or until they kick me out like one or the other until I make it or until they kick me out oh that was oh never mind I'll just make it right [Laughter] now everybody Scotty Barnes right here we're hoping you can show us around this place a little bit show us around so today we're shooting on these Google pixel phones what we're really trying to do is do a camera test and see what they're capable of basically these have gotten a lot better at shooting video and photos almost like a lot more like a real big camera so there's a couple of different tests we want to do so obviously you have your 1X right there yeah get your 5x which is Optical but you can keep going on the digital zoom and you'll see the processing take place because like it's still usable that in the past you would need some huge long lens in order to achieve this and look at the Quality how they're actually achieving that me zooming far away on them look at him he staring at me that's what I'm saying usually with,180.44,621.843,174.12199999999999
Unbox Therapy,llUlJjEb4qs,Phone,Google,phones you know you zoom in and it just like automatically is bur you can't really see it yeah but I think it's pretty solid you've also got obviously really wide this has a portrait mode on it this one it like isolates you from the background see how you get this blur over here yeah now typically on a smartphone shot that stuff's going to still be in Focus yes and normally that's really good the other thing that is doing in the background is trying to figure out the edge on your clothes over here see it's tough right but it actually does a pretty good job of isolating you from the back it does when you're dealing with the slowmo you can kind of grab a section like we're doing over here and you can pick whichever segment you want to be slowed down there's two different settings for like really slow or sort of slow then they've got another cool mode which is the Cinematic mode which like the portrait photo that tries to blur the background does the same but in video first shot ooh hey two [Music] woo again that was the one that's the one and then my my deep voice in slow-mo as well at the end of it celebrate that was your voice like wait what is that noise just uh explaining how how um like different the cord is when you're on it like versus on on TV,284.96,621.843,198.61199999999997
Unbox Therapy,llUlJjEb4qs,Phone,Google,well the whole stadium really it's like you get a it's intimate it's like a lot more intimate than you expect and the lighting is much better than you expect as well especially when you're on the court so like when we were talking about doing a camera test on these pixel phones and shooting video and photos we were like oh we're going to be struggling with lighting like it's like a relatively low light environment and it is in certain sections obviously as you like move up to uh higher seats and different positions to spectate but on the coure not only is it the lighting itself but it's also like the bounce off of and the Shimmer off of the the floor it gives you twice as much light as you might expect like the light color floor so obviously I've never played on this court or like barely played basketball in a while but this is such a satisfying bounce man and predictable bounce yep nope man that Rim is so unforgiving there we go so there you have it that is the new pixel 8 Pro and a very special camera test that we were able to run I got to give a shout out to Google mlsc and obviously Scotty Barnes for letting us come into his territory letting us have access to the court and kind of a like a life experience to be out there shooting threes at the Scotia Bank Arena like that was pretty cool who knows maybe in the future we'll we'll have some of these upgraded camera tests again hopefully you guys enjoyed it the pixel devices have come such a far away it started with the camera it's still about the camera so there you have it that's the new pixel 8 Pro,402.56,621.843,206.72

Unbox Therapy,0YBdiJTA-nM,Phone,Google,portability and one-handed functionality and don't want a giant Breck in their pocket so options are good here and we have a bigger distinction between the pro and non-pro instead of having too much overlap where they're kind of the same size and it's not really a huge difference between the options Hazel on the pixel 8 over here is obviously in the glossy finish but then that kind of contrasts a little bit with the bar that comes across holding the camera in place on the pixel 8 that's a matte finish like a brushed look whereas you get this chrome like shiny finish to go with the mat finish of the remainder of the phone so it's kind of a little bit of both just distributed differently the same goes for the frame of the device which is polished and shiny on the pro model it even has that little blue tint to it to match in with the main body of the phone this is my first glance at the camera Department yes we have that Periscope style Zo zoom lens 5x which Google claims is improved obviously on the latest generation we've also got the latest chip in both of these devices the G3 front-facing camera in the center of the unit SIM tray is on the Le hand side of the device type c on the bottom for quick charging power as well as a volume rocker in display fingerprint sensor 6.7 in device I'm very familiar with it because I spent a ton of time with the pixel 7 Pro obviously these are slightly different now the layout on the bar section has changed button layout similar however slightly different SIM tray in the same location and so is the type-c connector let's move over to the pixel 8 you know what now I really like,94.079,621.843,214.48100000000002
Unbox Therapy,0YBdiJTA-nM,Phone,Google,this color this Hazel kind of has that chalk like look to it that flat gray which is so popular right now and then the matte finish around the other elements including the frame of the device here aluminum frame and it has that brushed look to go with the glossy back very comfortable form factor now with this one your index finger kind of rests right below the camera bar giving you that really secure hold like it's actually resting on there incredible confidence and lots of reach for one-handed use obviously this is always a tough decision when debating between the two now you get the extra camera get a different battery size you've obviously got a bigger screen size as well if you go for the pro model however there's there's a comfort and confidence with the smaller unit for on the-go one-handed functionality it's a bit of a tossup let me know in the comments which one you'd be more interested in the Pro at 6.7 in or the non-pro at 6.2 now if we bring our comparison to the8 versus 7 you'll see these ones have changed quite a bit actually in form Factor so the 8 became more portable substantially more portable a little bit shorter for reachability and the corners kind of got rounded off a little bit more so one nice thing about having the bar on the back of the device is you don't get that typical tabletop wobble that you have with other devices that only have the camera module up in one corner these instead have a nice pleasing angle to them however no wobble associ at also in the smartphone space these camera units are some of the more distinctive like many other manufacturers are not quite,200.959,621.843,216.48100000000005
Unbox Therapy,0YBdiJTA-nM,Phone,Google,doing this and don't quite have this design language so it really helps to ID the phone and give it a distinctive personality camera units here look ever so slightly different the same is true of the 8 Pro versus 7 Pro the dimension is extremely close here but the curvature of those Corners is ever so slightly different just a little bit more curved on the new model something really interesting that's been added to the 8 Pro is a thermometer that can be pointed at food that you're cooking or other objects if you want to get a quick temperature reading unusual it is unusual but for me and in this space and the stuff I would use that fairly frequently honestly now of course I got to check if I can slap a later case on here so we do have pixel 8 and pixel 8 Pro this has quickly turned into my favorite color uh this one is called coffee on the website and it has this really fine texture to it incredibly thin and gives you a surprising amount of grip but keeps everything as streamlined as possible and as the company intended when they worked so hard to slim down the device and this one still maintains its distinctive look with this variety of cutouts pix 8 looking just as good actually I think this Frame here looks great with the coffee colored later case of course we've got other colors as well we've got the Crimson there's the blue there's the double black and then there's the classic with the Kevlar weave if you want an extremely thin and light yet strong case then I highly recommend you check out later case,309.4,621.843,206.2

Unbox Therapy,Iz7mtweC5tc,Phone,Google,welcome to the family latest pixel device a pixel device that we know and have known a lot about but it is finally here it is a pixel device that i think is going to be a popular pixel device there's a pixel challenge to say the word pixel as many times as i can in the early part of this pixel video because google actually transcribes it and the more times you say pixel the better it is for seo don't take that advice anyway it's the pixel 6a it's a lot like the other pixels but there's a catch it's cheaper and it's here for the summer 449 starting price up against the pixel 6 at 599 and the pixel 6 pro at 8.99 so it is your easiest way into the pixel lifestyle i think 449 pretty competitive price people's experiences with the last pixel phones seem to vary some found them to be buggy at least on launch my experience with the pixel 6 pro was good i didn't have any issues with it it produced incredible images i enjoyed the design having the latest android with some extra features packed in via google quick spec comparison before we crack into the box a 60 hertz fhd plus oled instead of the 90 on the regular 6 and the 120 on the 6 pro 6.1 inch display compared to 6.4 and 6.7 on the pro model ram and storage six gigs compared to eight on the pixel six and then 128 storage is the only option on the 6a where you can get 256 on the 6 and 512 gigs maximum on the pro model camera's a little bit different too on the main unit instead of having that 50 megapixel sensor you will have a 12 megapixel sensor here you will also have an ultra wide camera and that's the same 12 megapixel or at least on paper it's the same 12 megapixels that you're gonna get with the pixel six and six pro front camera for selfies is going to be eight megapixels let's crack into this and see what color we have they have some interesting names like sage and so forth i've been a pixel fan i might even throw my sim in this because something that i've been realizing over the years is how good the value phones have gotten for the vast majority of people you don't need to be spending a thousand dollars plus on a phone and you can still have a really good phone and maybe for myself to go from a 2 000 phone that's canadian to this would offer a nice little comparison of hey what do i feel like i'm missing where do i feel like i'm compromising maybe the value for money proposition is somewhere in the five to eight hundred dollar range could be a fun experiment also using a smaller phone could be fun because i've been using some big phones uh recently there it is that's the 6a and they did send us that sage color which is nice and they sent us a pixel 6a case however you know i've already got the 6a case from later case because i had to have this ready to go if i was going to use the phone so you can actually pick these up right now as well i'll link it in the description if you're gonna buy a pixel 6a you have another option for an even thinner case so the phone feels even more compact courtesy of kevlar they give you a case as well and this is translucent oh yeah so this is just your typical kind of uh plastic case it's actually a little harder more structured than you might expect what's interesting here you get the entire cutout for the,0.08,621.843,412.2410000000001
Unbox Therapy,Iz7mtweC5tc,Phone,Google,camera section that band across the back branding and identifying the product our model you can see you get a little bit more coverage there for protection when you lay it on the table it's not sitting on that module you just have openings uh individual apertures for the camera flash etc so here is the device they're calling it just sage very small package here compact unboxing experience kinda nice and sleek kind of compact look how they did the black around the edge you might not expect that with a sage color and the way that there's like these different tones along top and bottom there are selections not just for color in the first place but also for color combinations i think that's a look mo are we in agreement it's kind of a look with the two-tone thing going on up top here you can see the dual camera setup so that's another thing if i don't know if you're considering the pro model but obviously you would have a triple set up there instead of the dual here 12.2 megapixel 12 megapixel on the ultra wide the flash is in that section there we have our volume rocker over here the power switch above that and then over on the other side is your sim tray this is a matte finish on the aluminum frame on the bottom here some speakers as well as your type c connector for fast charging and then on the front we have our symmetrical front-facing camera in the center of the unit it is not the slimmest bezel in the game uh by any means the chin is ever so slightly larger than the forehead here acceptable type c to c cable they do give you the a to c adapter what's in this little box here sim tool circular style and your paperwork is a square welcome to your pixel the phone is very lightweight like this is one of those ones you put it in the shorts maybe you got the basketball shorts the athletic look going on and it's not weighing you down sometimes there's a feeling of quality when you have a heavier phone with like a stainless steel structure to it but it comes obviously at the cost of weight and there seems to be a trend towards lightweight phones for whatever reason and this is in that category very pixel experience welcome to your new pixel tap for tips yes it's a fully stock and latest android experience i'm noticing right away the 60 hertz scenario i don't know man maybe my brain has been broken by fast refresh on other devices but kind of wish it was possible to get the compact size of this phone with some of the features in like the pro model now i know that's asking a lot like this device with 120 or even 90 hertz i think would be more feasible for me on the daily but who knows that's one of those things where if you just switched over from a high refresh to this you're gonna notice it and maybe you're just gonna get used to it like this is what the conversation was around iphones for a really long time people just like i'm used to it leave me alone if it's fine for you it's fine for you and maybe i could adjust as well and notice it less this is the stock case the nice thing here is that it allows you to still see the color if you pick up like the sage phone however it obviously makes it,206.56,621.843,389.91999999999996
Unbox Therapy,Iz7mtweC5tc,Phone,Google,bulkier and kind of accentuates the fact that you don't have the slimmest bezels to begin with which happens with most cases except for this one which is the one obviously i would use on here this is the later case slimmer basically feels like the phone without any case on actually i think it enhances it a little bit with the texture and the grip and you see the full coverage over here in the camera section those camera sensors imx 363 dp plus optical image stabilization on the main camera and the ultra wide is imx 386 front facing camera 84 degree field of view imx 355 the battery around 4 400 milliamp hours charging not the fastest in the world 18 watt wired charging let's go ahead and load up the camera here this is obviously an area where pixel devices have excelled in the past so we have a 2x obviously no telephoto in here so you're just moving in a little bit on that sensor in an environment where you have some decent lighting that's the 2x and then obviously i'm zooming even more so than that here is your ultra wide and then your main camera unit tons of detail there one nice thing here as well as i just flip through these there's no weird color shift or issue with white balance or anything like that which is not always the case for devices in this environment i've done all types of comparisons pixel selfie comparisons in the past where other devices will like really do some funky stuff with the skin this one to me and it just for me looks a little bit more true to life which i like because i'm not really about most of those filters and so on for skin tones they have a they call it real tone and they claim all types of proficiency for a variety of skin tones from light to dark resolution up to 4k and frame rate up to 60. okay so this is a video sample 4k 30 frames per second the audio via the microphone which is on board on the pixel 6a and the image stabilization is turned on and that should give you an idea of 4k video performance obviously the audio that you are hearing is coming via the microphones on the 6a as well the audio test is maybe as impressive as the video test there super clear for dialogue if you're talking into cameron pointing at things they do have some voice enhancement features which aim to kind of diminish the competing noise and and focus in specifically on the dialogue there are stereo speakers in here whatever you want whatever uh style you want to attempt go for it we may we might build the concept the sound is very front frontal i think it's actually mostly because of this speaker unit up here the earpiece facing front if i is this something you can cover here you're getting sound out of the other side and if i cover there you're getting low end over there a fairly typical setup but overall clear sounding audio and that's one of those areas where you may find companies skimp a little bit when you're looking at their more budget-oriented devices,405.199,621.843,415.039
Unbox Therapy,Iz7mtweC5tc,Phone,Google,because that's not something that shows up on a spec sheet really they just oh stereo speakers okay well how good are those i've tried out enough phones to know that it's one of the places that cost cutting does occur it seems like it was an important consideration for this device oh fingerprint it is in display on this model maybe not the fastest we've seen it has a strong haptic gun [Music] how long are we gonna it's definitely not ultra fast like a little face unlock i know it's not as secure but sometimes the versatility there is nice so it's a bit unfortunate no face unlock option but you can live we have some fancy widgets we can long press and look at this stuff well wallpapers are readily available they're like intentionally blurred so your icons pop out so changing the wallpaper is essentially like a theme change this drop down menu change color as well so like if i go over here and switch back to something like this now you can see that the whole phone adapts to meet the criteria of that wallpaper some new widgets some new looks clock weather if i was to tap here and switch my wallpaper and style again you'll see that it'll carry through like it did before okay cool lovely some stylings if i even open calculator it will also have the theme applied as it does like isn't that a pretty looking calculator mo this is a test of the transcription function on the new pixel 6a from google thank you google yeah it's pretty bang on look at this mo it just keeps going and going and going and you're over there recording been a couple of hours and we're still goofing around on the new phone and i'm talking really casually to be honest and yet still every single word is transcribed effectively and there's something oddly satisfying about seeing my words turn into transcribed text as quickly as is happening here on the pixel 6a yeah it's good it's quality this is the type of stuff right here where google just destroys they did man voice and assistant that i use in the car on a daily basis i don't need to touch the screen i don't get distracted i stare at the road and i say i need to navigate to a particular place and it just nails it almost every single time just like that hey google set a timer for 10 seconds stop the alarm goes off in the morning just like stop stop oh quick phrases are kind of cool voice is kind of cool it's this area i've been talking about i feel like people are kind of sleeping on it never mind the snooze reference google is doing it well but a lot of other companies are not so people give up on voice it's one of those things where if it misfires too many times you just give up on it completely you know once we get into this conversational way of doing it where it's just start stop go to this place do this thing set this reminder the deeper that we can reach into the device and the variety of features in the device with our voices the more frequent our usage and the smarter it's going to get and you see,637.6,621.843,394.56300000000005
Unbox Therapy,Iz7mtweC5tc,Phone,Google,where this goes so they claim that the device has something called adaptive charging charges steadily overnight to preserve your battery hmm it's smart enough to use your alarm to completely charge by wake up it's all about balancing that charge when you don't need it to be fast all right so it's obviously not the fastest charging phone in the world 18 watts good enough for you 449 you do the math we're using of course a wonderful anchor power brick nano 2 45 watt capable more than enough power there and look at the size of it isn't that wonderful there we go charging rapidly full in one hour so from 66 to full in an hour maybe not your favorite recharge you've ever seen all right so there you have it it is a new pixel phone it is the pixel 6a it is the budget pixel phone and it's probably not gonna knock your socks off but it's not designed to do that this is the more affordable more approachable pixel device it is the more pocketable pixel device it does some things well like the camera it's got a hell of a chip in it however you take a step back a little bit going down to 60 hertz where the regular six is at 90 hertz and the pro model is all the way up at 120. the speakers sound good the charging not insanely fast you have the vanilla android experience which means you're kind of getting the most advanced features from google as soon as they become available and you're getting maybe the best interaction with things like assistant and so on i guess the question then becomes if you're in the market for a pixel phone which one should you be looking for i think for this customer base 449 i think they think they've kind of hit on some of the things that a pixel buyer would be looking for i wish that there was this form factor with some of the features that we come to expect on more sort of flagship devices like with the refresh and so on smaller phones require smaller prices for the most part and therefore they can't have every single feature packed in but this thing feels so portable and so comfortable coming from some of the devices i've been using recently that there is i don't know something compelling about that i think i'm gonna use it a little bit maybe have some more thoughts for you guys probably put it on uh lu later and it actually just wears this later case so well for the from the portability and sleekness perspective maybe the sim card goes in maybe i'm actually gonna go sit in the massage chair and get this thing set up do a little bit of a migration and see if it can work its way into my pocket thanks to pulsewave for sponsoring this episode pulseway is a real-time remote monitoring and management software application that allows you to solve technical issues on the go you can send commands from any mobile device and the software is compatible with windows mac and linux the pulseway app gives you remote desktop functionality so you can see logged in users get access to real-time status system resources monitor network performance manage windows updates and more pulseway is currently offering a free 14-day trial with no credit card info required plus you can get up to 20 off when you sign up with the link in the description,846.88,621.843,380.15799999999996
Unbox Therapy,sEEj3Qkfgms,Phone,Google,[Music] eat cookies what'd you have i had some cookies actually chocolate chip something with almonds and cinnamon and there's like fancy bags of cookies over there shout out mo well shut up shout out most life leave the day the day the day was made and then it got even more made because this showed up and you're like wait a sec lou i thought you already made a video well i made a video on the pro model of the new pixel pixel 6 pro we had all kinds of weird shipping stuff going on at the border and uh i don't even know which one i like better i don't even know which one is optimal pixel six or six pro obviously this is the smaller of the two but it's got some other specs as well they sent over their case for it too although i think we all know which case i'm gonna slap on it and i already got it over there the case i'm gonna slap on i know what type of case i'm gonna slap on it pixel six is a bit of a downgrade from the pro i mean,0.3,621.843,133.09900000000002
Unbox Therapy,sEEj3Qkfgms,Phone,Google,that's to be expected but the form factor might actually be more appealing to some users that don't want a big phone so this one is going to be stormy black as well as opposed to the cloudy white so that's probably going to fit into my later case a little nicer as far as the color is concerned as well yeah look at those tones all right so what's the difference pixel 6 is a 90 hertz display compared to 120 on the pro model it's also if you look at the back it's lacking that periscope style zoom lens so you're one camera less however in the past the pixel has been pretty good at digital zoom so maybe you can live batteries a little bit smaller around 500 milliamp hours less the resolution on the display is a slightly lower ppi 411 are you sure get the 4-1-1 remember 4-1-1 yeah it's like the phone number you call right yeah info 411 ppi is the pixel density oh but then i mean here's the key thing this thing is a lot less money so you're talking about 599 versus 8.99 and i think that might be a reasonable trade i really like this color stormy black but it's it's actually like a gray to it and you know what's weird about these two as well is the form factor is not all that different i mean yeah that phone's,71.119,621.843,166.721
Unbox Therapy,sEEj3Qkfgms,Phone,Google,bigger but it's it's kind of mostly just a tiny touch taller so i mean they're more similar than they are different do you need the zoom is 90 hertz enough for you you want to save some cash 300 bucks okay let me pull this off oh also inside the package same as the other one usb c to a cable for uh transitioning your gears over to your new device uh type c cable when there's a sim tool in there as well let me go ahead and boot this up maybe this form factor is actually a little maybe it's more pleasing i don't know [Music] i just registered my fingerprint on the regular pixel 6 and it reminded me of something i wanted to mention a little finding i have on the pixel 6 pro well both of them is the location of the scanner it's a little higher than you typically see it so it could be a little comfier for some people just something i thought was worth noting i have to say as i'm setting this up this form factor it might be a sweet spot this form factor in price if you don't need that zoom lens this i mean this might be the way to go it's a big leap 5.99 to 8.99 sometimes you just end up feeling like you want to have that,154.56,621.843,163.03900000000002
Unbox Therapy,sEEj3Qkfgms,Phone,Google,top spec but the chip is the same performance should be the same what a comfy place let's uh let's do some of this bang that's how easy it is yeah i don't know man because i am switching to one of these phones and i am having a dilemma at the moment this might be the absolute sweet spot form factor sweet spot am i gonna find myself in a circumstance where i wish i had the extra region to zoom it's quite possible but just on the day-to-day this might be the perfect size and oh by the way i should mention this little ridge acts as a shelf to hold the device you kind of find your index living around there especially on this size and you hold up some of the weight right there it's interesting you haven't seen it before [Music] [Applause] all right well anyway the embargo still stands i can't uh go into too much detail about either of these devices at this point in time you can show us the home screen i can show you the home screen the home screen default is a little bit different as well the background oh i can also tell you that i like this color better than the cloudy white oh,236.319,621.843,146.20800000000006
Unbox Therapy,sEEj3Qkfgms,Phone,Google,and another physical comparison the frame so you have this shiny stainless look with the cutout along top on and it's like a got a slicker feel to it on the pro model and then on the non pro it's like a matte finish around the edge you are lacking that singular change in texture along top instead you have your typical bands at least on this color [Music] okay so this is the official case recycled plastic pixel 6k pixel 6 case and this goes well with this color too a little bit more deliberate about the installation here there's also a two-tone thing going on now that i look at it the forehead is ever so slightly a different color anyway now i have to deliberate further figure out which one my sim card is going to go into and then also run a little comparison because these cameras have really been a benchmark in the past there's some some examples i want to see mo has a thing planned he's going to stack it up against the iphone 13 run it through a bunch of different camera scenarios and then i'm going to do the blind test where i'm going to look at the photos and see if i can distinguish which camera took it whether it was the pixel 6 6 pro or the latest iphone 13 pro it's going to be interesting it's coming soon on the channel so make sure to subscribe for that [Music],314.16,621.843,178.22000000000003
Unbox Therapy,qWed1Yye5Og,Phone,Google,this episode is sponsored by zen [Music] it is pixel day we have the brand new pixels i have to tell you right now they just showed up like last minute and it was a problem they were stuck at the border who cares why am i telling you that right now let's go ahead and and jump in and see what these new pixels are all about the exciting part here is i'm probably gonna switch to this phone i'm just gonna say it i've been a pixel person pixel peeper pixel i just even before they were pixels with the nexus and stuff i always want to see what google's up to on the stock hardware the vanilla android experience and this is the latest one so i'm going to pop a sim in oh i should also mention later case stuff just arrived later case stuff super thin cases for these pixels the links gonna be down in the description of this video and we'll pop those on and check them out as well all right so this is uh oh this is like some is that soap i think that's so kind of reminiscent of a rubik's cube or something but smells very fresh oh look at this h2go 18 ounce bottle okay cool what is this i mean it smells very fresh i'll take it oh what is this chocolate the google team is thrilled to have you play a partner launching pixel 6. we're looking forward to joining a big reveal and the inside out pixel 6 is the first all google phone the first all google phone interesting so saying this is google the true way google intended what does that mean i don't know main event whoa look at that remember pop-up books pixel 6 pro the pixel camera system includes a pro level telephoto lens smooth display intelligently adjusts up to 120 hertz and with the google tensor processor,0.08,621.843,236.591
Unbox Therapy,qWed1Yye5Og,Phone,Google,it's the smartest fastest pixel yet it looks like i have a case and a 6 pro cloudy white i can't say i've ever heard of cloudy white before nothing else that's just box right 6.7 inch display 128 gb of yes storage and no knife necessary in order to open it up we have these two tiny little pulls one and two oh that is cloudy white is the way i would describe this that's a very accurate i like it so glass and polished and kind of a premium feel to it straight away very slender band around the outside where you grab a very distinctive look too we've seen so many different camera bulges in the past this is the first camera visor it's looking like cyclops it's looking like daft punk you've seen all the memes already also in the package google type c cable no power brick that's just the way the world right now they do give you an adapter though usb c to a little bit of paperwork and of course a sim tool it's like a tiny little circle that is google's tiny little sim tool the device is 6.7 inch it's not enormous i guess in my hand obviously there's some even bigger phones out there there will be a smaller version as well for people that may prefer although this is going to be your flagship of of the flagships the camera setup up here one two look at that periscope style lens zoom capable of course your flash is over there as well i'm gonna peel how about a peel front-facing camera in the center area here symmetrical this is interesting along the top another polished section but it almost well it's white and it kind of has is it just paint or is it a different material it feels kind of like when they,132.4,621.843,248.079
Unbox Therapy,qWed1Yye5Og,Phone,Google,said oh we have a ceramic phone i don't know that that's what it's made out of but anyway you have a white segment inside of the band presumably for communications and radios and such your sim tray is going to go in this location here volume up and down and your power switch oh yeah and then on the bottom usb type-c port for charging looks like your speakers are there as well my main feedback immediately here is that google has definitely gone up market like they really want your iphone money that's what's happening over here keep in mind this is a preliminary unboxing so it's like no comparisons and such i'm gonna go ahead and set it up real quick all right so here is the case this is a pretty standard thing other than adapting to this very unusual cutout the visor style cutout but otherwise this is a typical clear case google logo is still there i don't know what is getting ready it still says it'll take a few minutes i don't know if the software is final because of course the documentation says no analysis or evaluation of software i'm going to show you the home screen obviously but there are limitations leading up to the final embargo and we may very well see software updates along that ride of course it's the cyber edition so we have the kevlar in this case wrapping around the entire camera section on this particular device that's all going to be touching the table because of the angle you're going to place it on so by installing this case what's going to happen is you're going to actually cover that entire section up so now it's resting on the kevlar instead of the glass where your cameras are and such and it gives it a kind of cool look like that's very cyber hence the name cyber edition so you can actually order these right now i'll put the link in the description but imagine that you can order up,256.56,621.843,224.23999999999998

Unbox Therapy,ZFJjrwkyhtE,Phone,Samsung,just a little spring it just it gave me a nice little feedback you gotta slide at the same moment it's a two-stage authentication I see s23 Ultra highest smartphone resolution 200 megapixels you're getting a pen now another key oh that is an enormous track pad that's the new Galaxy book 3 Ultra you can get RTX in here up to 40 70. up to 32 gigs of RAM one terabyte of storage pcie expansion slot you're going to also have 13th gen Intel Core i7 400 nit display with 120 hertz refresh and resolution 2880 by 1800 otherwise known as 3K it's not too much as far as like frilliness is concerned it's just not trying to do too much is it you're the type of guy that's got yourself an Ultra phone you've now got the Ultra Book to go with to go with it [Music] oh what what the oh okay I think the puzzle Lords gave you a break on this yeah finally geez do you know what this is this is just like a cool box non-discreet there you go will you're on the board yeah s23 plus we have cream green lavender and Phantom black now normally I would go with Phantom black this green is kind of intriguing to me I would go for the green as well s23 look at this look at that that's compact 6.1 inch Dynamic AMOLED also 1750 nits of brightness and 120 hertz 12 megapixel selfie so camera layout looks pretty much identical 50 megapixel wide 12 megapixel Ultra wide and a 10 megapixel telephoto 3900 milliamp hours eight gigs of RAM up to 256 storage simple one-handed functionality it's got a kind of like an Inky look to it on the bigger model you're gonna have a bigger battery so bigger display bigger battery but the one-handed functionality pocket ability portability you know where that goes that goes to the standard model that is a comfortable form factor holy cow the granddaddy oh boy just immediately looks the toughest doesn't it it looks angry and it's like you know what get away from me that's what this one's saying these are labeled l f r oh that's inside of this box is our key to my next smartphone really I am using this s23 Ultra front right back left I'll give it a shot oh look at this one this one's different two biters over there one over there things are different it does make a sound but I do think it starts with this one a latch oh okay this one went down oh oh see what's going on man stuff is happening here boys you got it dude you got it dude let's go we don't need no stinking clue The Puzzle Master and even your dog is proud of you thanks buddy be the star of the shot even at night so obviously we're gonna have night mode in there some pretty intense low light performance because of the fancy stuff that you can do with the 200 megapixel sensor yeah that's the key 6.8 inch Dynamic AMOLED display 1750 nits 120 hertz screen refresh 12 megapixel selfie 12 megapixel Ultra wide 200 megapixel wide angle 10 megapixel 2 telephoto lenses 5 000 milliamp hour battery 8 or 12 gigs of RAM and up to one terabyte of storage with a built-in S Pen what more do you want and the,236.34,621.843,447.7989999999999
Unbox Therapy,ZFJjrwkyhtE,Phone,Samsung,green which is definitely my favorite color so they maintain some of that curve on the ultra model which makes as you know bigger devices 6.8 inch devices feel smaller than they actually are S Pen down at the bottom fidget button for you yeah speed all that camera action going on including this folded Style zoom lens this used to require such a huge bulge and you know I'm kind of over it would you use the word it's very minimal you already knew that I was going to select this one regardless I have a tendency towards these Ultra models did you feel it yet but you solved the puzzle yeah all right now you know I gotta gravitate towards this Ultra model because I'm going to be using this this is going to be my daily driver that SIM card is going to go into this unit I obviously slap a later case onto there s23 Ultra cyber Edition already available and this is going to be the slimmest way to get a case on your device check that out that is crazy slim wonderful Kevlar texture as well so this is actually shipping right now click the link in the description and pick one of these up protection for your device I want to see how this thing does just watching some video get a sense for the audio and the visual colorful we really can begin to appreciate how slim the bezel is on this thing detail beard hairs let's boost the volume as well okay let me tell you it brought that sniff it brought it right up to me it came right up to me and started sniffing around it was right inside my uh Model S right in there right oh you're gonna be happy on a multimedia side no doubt awesome looking display no surprises here [Music] now when you pop out the pen on this model you are prompted to use a number of features screen right smart select notes live messages Doodles and so forth it's like I'm writing on paper use your S pen to write in search Fields address bars and other text areas your handwriting will be converted to text but you can still Scratch Out add to and edit the converted text with your S Pen so what's cool about this is it's actually case sensitive as well and you hover your pen you get a little pen indicator [Music] unbox therapy look at that Nails it and K sensitive to just reach up and scroll through content quickly and then also you've got applications for things like art if you want to do some doodling or drawing when it is in its little Silo you don't even need to think about it when you have the silo it's always with you but it's not bothering you it's constantly ready to use all right let's jump into these cameras real quick in photo mode we have this wild new 200 megapixel sensor four different focal length options immediately 0.6 which is your Ultra wide 1X 3 and 10x for the zoom so we have expert raw we have a pro mode for photo a pro mode for video we now have meters we can see our f-stop,463.319,621.843,371.781
Unbox Therapy,ZFJjrwkyhtE,Phone,Samsung,exposure compensation white balance if you look below here you can see that crazy four three 200 megapixel capture why don't I go ahead and take one right now now that creates an absolutely massive image a tremendous ability to re-crop like I mean the detail here is kind of insane so when you're in your standard mode and in most circumstances that standard mode is going to be sufficient having options is a good thing though jump all the way out to 0.6 this is so wide that we can actually see Mo over there we'll go into 3x now Optical and the 10x Zoom wow here you can see what happens with good zoom whether it happens to be 3x or 10x and this is the versatility you get with this particular camera system in the ultra moving over to video here in landscape you can see we have fhd 30. however we can go all the way up to 8K 30 or UHD 60 which I'll select here so this is a test of the 1X camera with the super steady enabled say hi MO these stabilization capabilities have advanced substantially the stabilization settings in here if you're willing to put up with a little bit of a crop are quite impressive there's also pro video it's giving you things like meters for audio which is useful you could start an entire YouTube channel with this device right here the mic even has different settings for Omni front and rear it's comprehensive and this is not a third-party app this is right inside of the camera software so that's pretty cool to see good Lord this is obviously a tremendous number of pixels we are currently shooting 8K video at 30 frames per second eight K video stock display settings adaptive brightness there is an extra brightness feature what Samsung does in their settings is they let you just toggle extra brightness if you want to have it there obviously this comes at the expense of battery life so you need to be aware of that when it comes to smoothness or refresh it is currently out of the box in the Adaptive mode you can also go into a standard mode which won't switch it will lock at 60 hertz Vivid natural and then also white balance so you can tweak and tune the display to your own personal preference by default it's fhd plus which is improve visuals with moderate battery use of course we can go all the way up to the screen's actual resolution wqhd plus can basically set this thing up however you see fit we have each model in each color including a Showcase of the new cream color that's what it is right there it's kind of like a pearl sort of it's just a little bit more luxurious maybe than stark white or like winter snow type of white you can get it in the Phantom black you can get it in the cream and it's also available in the lavender just like the plus model there the scope of the offerings you can let me know down in the comments which one you would pick as far as which model as well as which color new laptops from Samsung this is their 16 inch model with that high-end spec gaming capable,660.3,621.843,374.63899999999995
Unbox Therapy,ZFJjrwkyhtE,Phone,Samsung,actually with the RTX built in but there's a couple of other models as well so this one a little bit more slender and portable it's a 13 inch they're calling this Pro and we're still getting a fairly large track pad very similar keyboard layout this thing is incredibly thin and light extremely minimal so this is the pro 360 model and as the name implies that's going to be your convertible all the way around which is pretty cool it creates a really large tablet style input when you have it folded all the way back and it's actually reasonably lightweight insanely thin this model just look at that profile from the side all right so let's go ahead and talk a little bit about pricing Galaxy s23 is going to come in at 800 bucks at least to start the 256 model goes up to 859 then you move into the plus version so 256 over there is 9.99 and then the 512 gigabyte version which isn't available on the non-plus model goes to 11.99 11.99 to start for the ultra model and then if you want to go up to 512 1379 is what you're looking at these of course are USB prices all right now one thing that is not going to be included in the package with your new s23 is a charge brick this is just life in 2023 but it's okay because we have anchor looking after you a wonderful supporter of the show and makers of many fine charging products I have two models that would be perfect for either or any of the s23 models essentially we have a 25 watt option at 14.99 and we have a 45 watt option at 29.99 now if you want the more basic approach and you want to save some cash then you just go for this model which as mentioned 14.99 should be available on Amazon as well as anchors website both of which will be listed down in the description now what I love about this is the flip down prongs this just means that when you are traveling with it it is not going to poke you in your pocket but what if you want to charge other devices that can actually make use of even more power or if you just want to have a 45 watt capable power brick then you gravitate towards this one you spend a few more bucks 29.99 and what's cool here is things actually shrink with the charge Tech that's inside of here this one is more square like you once again have flip down prongs so that this is extremely pocketable and what I like about the 45 watt size is that it will charge most of your other devices if you have tablets even if you want to top up like a laptop depending on the laptop this thing's just going to be a little bit more capable let's give it a crack now of course course you will be able to use either of these bricks with the included USBC to C cable that Samsung does give you [Music] and as you can see there rapid charging the device is currently at 30 and it says 58 minutes until full so this is the ultra model which obviously has that 5000 milliamp hour battery you get slightly more portability with the 45 watt and obviously greater capability for devices that go beyond just your smartphone so the choice is yours 15 bucks or 30 bucks shout out to Anchor shout out to anchor for keeping us charged foreign,847.92,621.843,399.737
Unbox Therapy,OlapSPEs5YI,Phone,Samsung,this is insane this is intense we have absolutely everything um we have the entire factory here this is everything that you're going to be seeing at the event that samsung just put out and it's all here right now s22 phantom white green gold black s22 plus phantom white green s22 ultra phantom white these are the two retail packages every accessory known to man wireless charger duos travel chargers the later cases which are done i've also got the tablets and the tablet covers this is going to be information dense we're going to go over and unbox absolutely everything you're going to relax and enjoy i'm flying here we go i am flying here we go um this is we're professionals here today [Applause] um let's go over some pricing s22 starts at 7.99 the plus 9.99 the ultra 11.99 if you happen to be in canada you're going to be starting at 10.99 and then all the way up to 22.09 if you happen to get the 12 gigabyte ram one terabyte of storage however there are some promotions i'll put the details down in the description expensive phones you already knew that when you clicked on this video do not be surprised we are in premium land right now all right specifications s22 6.1 inch fhd plus amoled s22 plus 6.6 inch fhd 120 hertz for both of these devices and we have a three camera array to choose from ultrasonic fingerprint is in there as well those two models are going to ship with eight gigs of ram and your choice of storage 256 or 128 now let's get to the exciting part the s22 ultra in this box right here that's 6.8 inches of wqhd plus resolution amoled 120 hertz refresh 240 hertz touch sampling ultrasonic fingerprint scanner one two three four five different cameras good lord ram options from eight gigs up to twelve storage all the way up to one terabyte battery life in the ultra five thousand milliamp hours now we have pen input it was rumored it's here today it's happening on the ultra model and so is the name we're sticking with the ultra name which is pretty cool so once again here's my suggestion that you sit back and relax and we have ourselves a time this is pink gold we have this kind of like squared off grip subtle camera hump compared to others there's your triple camera layout matte finish on the main portion of the device i'm gonna peel this off right now there we go this is gonna be very fingerprint resistant but it is still glass blasted now when you look around the outside of the device that's where things get shiny this is your usb type-c port for charging sim tray speaker this section here is for what antenna that's antennae okay power switch volume rocker over here we have the symmetrical layout with the front facing camera it's a tiny little pinhole style the whole thing is flat that's important to note so there's no curvature here on the display at all have your usb cable your sim tool and then a variety of accessories that you can pick up depending on what you want we have a 45 watt power adapter this is the reality of the situation in 2022 premium phones you're going to bring your own power adapter so this is your compact super fast charging is what they call it a much longer usb c cable slightly more robust than the one that is included in the package 65 watt power adapter this one doesn't have a usb cable in the package but look at this 65 watt type c 25 watt type c and then 15 watt type a that'll be one charger to rule them all for you and it's from samsung that's just standard c2c 1.8 meters this is the go-to top-tier status flagship status a lot of people can be looking at this device if they want everything and they don't care about the cost they just want ultra status it's in the name and now we got pen input on this device look at this with its own place to live previously this was a note only thing now we have this kind of hybrid device that merges together the best of the ultra series with the best of the note series here you can see the camera layout embedded inside no more enormous hump over here but still allowing you to have this zoom lens design embedded in the unit so they've had to do some serious engineering to fit everything in flat on the table almost no wobble very little wobble on the table lots of camera variety over here and i'm gonna remove this portion here look at that finish that's that phantom black type of look once again it's a matte finish right there now you know what i do in this case i go ahead and slap this on this is the brand new later case for the ultra model check this out just clip it on like that keeps the same matte finish and slenderness just sort of blends with the phantom black around the edges as well i'm always cognizant of any case making an already big phone even bigger so i like to have the slim as possible it's the whole concept behind the later case in the first place and yes all these are ready to go for the s22 models so you can check the link in the description and order one of these right now you can even order it in advance of getting your new device so you're ready to go flat bottom on the bottom side very reminiscent of the note series type c port is going to be down there next to your sim tray this is your pen housing perfect little s pen including a button and then of course my favorite part the ability to click at the top which is for anyone who likes to fidget that's a nice little bonus over here we have our power switch,0.0,621.843,688.6170000000001
Unbox Therapy,OlapSPEs5YI,Phone,Samsung,volume rocker on the right hand side where you'd expect it a little protector here now unlike the regular s22 model this is your curved design little bit of a waterfall over the edge i think when you get into a much bigger phone it's a little easier to hold with the curvature on the side but there is a certain sense of confidence you get by having the flat edge as well all right so we have s22 ultra s22 plus now this is gonna be your entry level so this one's around a thousand bucks the most compact version of the s20 one-handed functionality small phones have gotten popular recently this green color is a very nice that is a dark dramatic forest if it had a smell it would be incredible it's like a morning there's a little fog over there there's a dampness to it but it's a nice kind of um you know the smell of the earth yes it wakes you know it's um it might repeat it it might be pizza p-e-t this is a comfy hold i don't know now i'm conflicted because that is a comfy hold i know i want this whole spec sheet and look how cool that thing looks but that that's a comfy that's a comfy hold i'm conflicted let me try this out yes ooh i'm compact streamlined i'm in the pocket but you don't even know will's even looking cause this is the one he wants in this studio you would go for this one i'm pretty sure kirk you would go for this one mo moco's big time what ultra mo so we're going to go ahead and speed this up because we want to see every single that's the whole point of this comprehensive video i'm pretty sure it'll be the only video like this in the entire internet where you're going to be able to compare and contrast every single model and color white and silver pink and gold little one of that let's see if the black is exactly the same as the ultra this phantom black in the video it doesn't really do it justice i know what you're saying you're like isn't that just marketing stuff they're always talking about how black their black is but it is very satisfying green that's a nice green too it's gonna be a tough choice here we're gonna force everybody to pick black plus whoa this is called burgundy it looks like a fine wine purple maroon that's a run for the money right there it's tough man they got to keep coming up with new colors all the time that's the most surprising color of the bunch i would say most unexpected and then the white model take a second you don't have to immediately dive in i know it's tempting you can do whatever you need to do you can smell you can even handle but you got to be honest that's the main yeah honestly i think i'm going wildcard i would go 22. white why because what neon green i don't know i like the what i i really like the burgundy but i also really like the way this looks okay so we have kirk's selection the small most portable uh form factor the most pocketable of the bunch uh but be honest okay okay i think i actually might go with this one just a little bit bigger i do like the green let's go yeah he goes s-22 plus in green ultra black or burgundy oh no it's close though because it's exclusive all right so yeah ultra mo is a real thing it's not a character i created it it's an action no no no no no no no no no doodles it looks great on you can we get you can we get you to take a phone call on the ultra first i accept the call like this okay and then i go like this show the camera this is the ultra mo can i give us a wink the future you know what dude no no that's not happening again i think a lot of people given this set of options would go this direction with the exclusive color now you guys let me know down in the comments which of this bunch you would select and why i'm curious to see uh where the sentiment is and if we have like some sort of a vote is the ultra that much more popular or are are people trending towards some smaller phones at lower price points let's go ahead now and move on to some of these accessories maybe the most exciting accessory for me this is the super fast wireless charger duo 15 watt wireless charging of course we'll do your galaxy phone watch and buds it's available in white and black 89.99 usd ooh look at this so there's a type c cable look at these rubber feet this is gonna be on your bedside table looks like it has some cooling there type c connector on the back bone and buds and then watch and buds gonna do uh two different sections at once two different led lights oh i realized i didn't pick my device either before we do this charger my setup i would either go with the small one it's not gonna happen i'm just gonna take the ultra this device represents like a new uh segment for them because of the whole situation with the note and the ultra and i just feel like every single time a device with a pen comes out i want to remember what that's like to have the pen option for an input and then it doesn't hurt that the spec sheet here is just ridiculous and the

CNET,7LjHwRhn0TA,Phone,Google,"charging thank you Apple for finally making our lives easier with that and we cannot talk about these phones phones without also comparing prices the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,200 for 256 GB and you can get that same storage option on the pixel 8 Pro for just over $1,000 both phones also come in 1 tab options if you're willing to throw in a few extra100 the iPhone 15 Pro Max comes in black white blue and natural titanium while the pixel 8 Pro comes in black white and blue or Bay as Google calls it and then you have to think about how long these phones will last you and I don't mean whether you crack the screen or drop it in water because that's on you but I mean OS updates Google promises 7 years of software updates with the pixel 8 Pro Apple doesn't commit to a specific number of years but right now iOS 17 support goes back 5 years to the iPhone 10s 10s Max and 10r so we've got great cameras vibrant displays and Stellar battery life on both so which one would I reach for I'm thoroughly impressed by the pixel8 pros portrait mode and prefer how images like selfies look brighter and less shadowy and I am a huge fan of the faster charging the AI features are super cool and I love that if there's something I don't like about a photo I can just easily erase or tweak it but what sells me about the iPhone is the unbeatable allaround video quality especially when it comes to cinematic mode and that longer battery life the display was also a huge selling point for me I appreciate how much sharper and more vibrant images and videos look on the iPhones display and I know you're probably tired of hearing this if you're an Android User like I once was but that Apple ecosystem just can't be beat so pairing really great Hardware with great software makes me want to reach for the iPhone 15 Pro Max but honestly it was really close between these two phones no matter which one you go for you're going to have a really high-end experience it just depends what you're most interested in whether it's photos videos watching movies whatever which phone would you choose or have you already chosen let us know your thoughts in the comments and don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and And subscribe for more on all things mobile thanks for watching",474.039,621.843,260.3209999999999

CNET,6FkQa6pNOTI,Phone,Apple,version of the game is actually a cloud-based game this means the game isn't actually being run locally on the hardware but streamed over the internet in order to play Resident Evil Village on a switch your device must be connected online at all times both the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Xbox versions will be running locally here we have the iPhone version of the game running you can see the game features touch controls if you'd like but I decided to use a controller instead specifically I'm using the backbone One controller clip which connects to an iPhone or Android phone and gives you all the controller inputs you'd expect I love this device and I've used one for years I'll leave a link in the description if you want more information what you're looking at here is the game running at its default display settings what's really great about this version of the game is that you can fine-tune your graphics much like you would on a PC game on default the iPhone does a good job of having the,55.719,621.843,100.88199999999999
CNET,6FkQa6pNOTI,Phone,Apple,game Run smoothly but it actually ends up looking the worst compared to the other two platforms we can see the textures are less detailed in both the surroundings and in character clothing ground textures are noticeably worse with less density of things like foliage and texturing when we crank everything up to the Max from 1280 by 720 up to 2796 by 1290 you can see the visuals improve greatly but add a large hit to Performance character movement is so slow here that it's pretty much unplayable outside of visuals it's worth addressing the platform we're using the phone is designed to dim and eventually lock itself when there's no screen interaction for a set period of time the game doesn't stop this like when you're watching a movie this meant that during some of the longer cut scenes the game would pause itself and my phone would lock when playing last thing worth noting is that the phone ran very hot during all of this I can only imagine how much hotter it may have gotten when pushed above default settings luckily I,105.96,621.843,109.87899999999999
CNET,6FkQa6pNOTI,Phone,Apple,had the controller clip so I didn't actually feel much of this while gaming but I can't imagine playing this with touch controls and having it heat up so drastically on top of that it's unsurprising that the Xbox version of the game looks the best out of the three platforms on the series s it displays a 1440p signal at around 45 frames per second and while this isn't the best possible version of the game it is clearly the best in this comparison textures and lighting are the most dynamic and performance is smoothest it's the most powerful platform we have here so of course it would end up on top the switch version looks a lot muddier than the Xbox ground and foliage textures look compressed and less detailed there's also noticeable leg due to the cloud nature of the game even though I'm running on a Wi-Fi connection of around 250 down and 100 up you can see how constantly fighting with the camera over shooting and not tracking smoothly with my inputs it doesn't help that you have this signal strength icon,160.879,621.843,112.40099999999998
CNET,6FkQa6pNOTI,Phone,Apple,displayed in the top right corner at all times I guess this is kind of similar to the notch cutout you have to live with on the iPhone overall not a great way to play this game and I don't know why anyone would choose this option I'll show off a few more scenes side by side for you now damn it's you the child's father between the three platforms the Xbox is the clear standout with the iPhone 15 Pro coming up next and the switch coming in last place this isn't a surprising outcome but it was great to see how well the phone version played outside of the heating issue this is a totally serviceable way to play through Resident Evil Village if a console or PC isn't an option and when compared to the next most portable device the Nintendo switch it absolutely blows it out of the water I never want to touch the switch version again and I recommend you don't either but what do you think of the three options and how they compare let me know in the comments and thanks for watching,216.92,621.843,117.23900000000002

CNET,WjvnTosXaSo,Phone,Google,let's dive in and see what the pixel 8 Pro has to offer physically it's clear to see the family resemblance with this big camera bar running along the back I don't think it looks quite as classy or premium looking as the sage and gold of this pixel 7 Pro certainly not in the plain black version I initially reviewed although this light blue one does have a little bit more personality the 6.7 in display is the same size as the 7 Pro and it looks glorious colors are Punchy and vibrant and easily do justice to whatever vibrant colorful Netflix or YouTube video you're watching it supports HDR content it's bright enough to actually use outdoors and it has a maximum 120 HZ refresh rate for smooth scrolling and gaming this small circle next to the camera flash houses a new feature a temperature sensor now that allows the phone to take temperature readings from objects or surfaces directly in front of it and it's easy enough to do you just fire up the temperature app and hold the phone about 5 cm away from whatever it is you want to scan sort of like if you were taking a close-up photo tap the screen and it'll give you a temperature reading of that object the idea is that you can check the temperature of a drink before you take a Big Gulp or check that that piece of pie isn't hotter than the sun before you shovel it into your face it worked fairly well in my testing and I can imagine some examples where it might be quite useful maybe you're a parent wanting to check the temperature of a baby's bottle but over all I do think its real world use is quite limited it kind of feels like a feature that's been shoehorned in just to act as a differentiator against the competition and sure the pixel 8 Pro now has a big,115.159,621.843,211.92200000000003

CNET,WjvnTosXaSo,Phone,Google,areas where I definitely feel it's lacking in power especially those long wait times to create AI edits in general use though it does feel Swift and responsive and demanding games like genin impact and pubg all played with smooth frame rates even at high settings so let's talk about those cameras the cameras were my biggest concern in my initial review due to various image processing problems I found under certain conditions several of our initial test images in high contrast situations showed bizarr looking artifacts in the shadowy areas along with extremely aggressive software noise reduction that smoothed out areas that should have had detail Google pushed out an update to help resolve some of these issues and while it has gone a long way to rectifying them they haven't gone away completely but it's a much more minor issue now showing up very rarely and in very specific circumstances for the most part the camera is excellent taking vibrant sharp and well exposed images in a variety of conditions in good conditions the main ultrawide and five times telephoto zoom camera all took beautiful shots that comfortably rivaled the same shots that I've seen on the iPhone 15 pro at night the iPhone generally performs better but the pixel 8 Pro is still a huge step up in night skills over the pixel 7 Pro the phone has other new camera features as well including manual set settings for adjusting shutter speed and white balance as well as a new 50 megapixel mode for taking highres photos the extra resolution over the Standard 12 megapixels is certainly noticeable when you zoom in on those details but to be honest most photographers won't need to use it especially as the 1 to 2 second delay required to take each photo means,329.0,621.843,223.88099999999994
CNET,WjvnTosXaSo,Phone,Google,it's only really suitable for static scenes like Landscapes overall the pixel 8 Pro's camera is excellent and I am really glad that I've spent all the extra time in testing it following Google's update it can take beautiful photos in all conditions and its night mode is a big step up over the predecessor that heavy-handed image processing though is still visible and dedicated photographers among you are still probably going to be better served with the iPhone 15 Pro so what do I like about the pixel 8 Pro well I like its gloriously vibrant display I like its generally solid cameras and I love that extended software support period what I don't like is the underwhelming processor performance the middling battery life that heavy-handed image processing in some photos and the fact that some of its key new features kind of feel like gimmicks so is it a phone that you should buy collectively we've spent countless hours testing all the features of the pixel 8 Pro and taking hundreds of test photos with all of its cameras despite my earlier concerns I am confident that the pixel 8 Pro is a solid Android phone to consider especially if you're into nighttime photography but overall it doesn't feel like a huge step up over the pixel 7 Pro and certainly if you've got a 7 Pro it's absolutely not worth an upgrade but those of you on older pixel phones or on other Android phones more than 2 or 3 years old will absolutely benefit from some of the key upgrades in this phone what do you think to the pixel 8 Pro is it the phone for you or are your eyes set elsewhere do make sure to leave your thoughts in the comments below and make sure to check out the video description for a lot more information,440.84,621.843,214.961

CNET,8Ilw2NR0Fyc,Phone,Google,[Music] this is the Google pixel 8 and I'm not even going to bother with a proper intro because I want to show you something okay bring up the title graphic and let's get into my review so on the pixel 8 there's a feature called best take which I keep referring to as face swap essentially I take a few photos in a row of a person a couple or a group and I could pull up a face and head editor again that's that's my term not Google's and swap a person's head with their head from another image that's in the same series to get their best head for a given photo the result is I have a photo where everyone's eyes are open and everyone's smiling now philosophically this photo doesn't actually exist because it never happened and yet here it is at first I was creeped out by best take but it's absolutely incredible I mean it works remarkably well I can't see the lines where people's heads were swapped and it only works on people but I can almost hear Rick ostero say at the pixel 9 or pixel 10 launch we heard you and we're going to offer best take for pets Applause and cheers after 4 days spent testing the pixel 8 on loan from Google I still can't get my head around the possibilities that best take opens up our photography can be even more curated and seemingly deal before we even share a photo with friends or on social media thanks to AI which yay and there are more of these AI features for the camera which I'm definitely going to get into but let's step away from the possible personality altering ramifications of best take and knock out some actual tangible pixel 8 upgrades in terms of the hardware the pixel 8 is a spelt version of the pixel 7 it's shorter less wide but actually a sco thicker the pixel8 weighs 10 G less than the seven and when you combine all of that along with the fact that nearly every Edge on the phone is rounded over the pixel 8 is,0.73,621.843,259.07
CNET,8Ilw2NR0Fyc,Phone,Google,incredibly comfortable to hold with or without a case the review unit I've been testing is rose color which in most lighting looks nearly Peach the screen is smaller but so are the bezels around it uh the pixel8 6.2 in display now has a 60 to 120 HZ variable refresh rate and it looks so good especially watching films playing games or even just looking at mundane Android 14 animations the screen has a higher Max brightness and is easy to see under bright sunlight especially compared to the pixel 7 and 7A where that really wasn't the case overall the pixel8 looks Dapper and well almost Chic it's still defined by that body withd camera bar on the back which I really like that camera bar houses the the same 12 megapix ultrawide camera as previous pixel models but it's also home to a 50 megapix main camera with a new sensor that Google touts as being able to collect 21% more light the front-facing camera is also new but on the 8 still has a fixed [Music] Focus the cameraa has a bit of a redesign in fact on the bottom is a toggle for two cat atories uh one for Stills photos and one for video if I tap the camera icon I get all my regular camera modes like portrait mode long exposure if I tap the video camera icon I get all my modes for videos I really like this it did take about a day to get used to the new system but I think it's a clever way of housing a bunch of different camera features and still what is considerably a very simple camera app also the pixel8 has a new macro Focus mode that kicks in when you're close to the subject on screen an icon pops up letting you know what's up I really like this addition and it's great for food and coffee snaps where I want to get close enough to the cup to fill the frame but I also still want it in Focus now let's take a look at some of my favorite photos and videos I took with the pixel,130.16,621.843,261.51900000000006
CNET,8Ilw2NR0Fyc,Phone,Google,8 so does the pixel 8 take better photos than the pixel 7 yes but not dramatically different now check out these photos of the Manhattan Bridge that I took both look great but if we punch in on where the main upright intersects the deck of the bridge you can see that the pixel 8 image has more detail and is sharper notice the individual rivets on the metal uprights compared to the pixel 7's photo where most of them are gone again this isn't dramatically different but it's better nonetheless and here's another example this time it's two photos taken in low light of a New York cat sleeping in the window it was dark but there was enough light that I didn't need to use night sight on either phone again both photos look similar at first glance but if we zoom in on the cat notice the detail and texture in the cat's fur in the pixel 8 image and how defined and crisp the hair is compared to the pixel 7 photo where the cat's fur looks muddy and then there are all of the AI features like best take which I mentioned at the beginning oh by the way best take not only works on photos taken with the pixel 8 but on any photos in your Google photos Library so last month I reviewed the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max and I'm able to take photos that I shot with those phones like this one of CET ABR alhi and swap out her face with ones from other images in that same series also remember Magic Eraser that lets you remove a distraction in your photo like maybe someone in the background that you didn't want well now there's a magic editor that lets you do even more for example here's a photo I took of CET terara Brown and Theo lians jumping off a rock I used Magic Eraser which debuted on the pixel 6 to remove the Rock and it did okay but here's the same photo using the new magic editor and and it's not absolutely perfect but there's definitely improvement over just the,268.6,621.843,246.72099999999998
CNET,8Ilw2NR0Fyc,Phone,Google,Magic Eraser version Magic editor can do a lot like you can move your subject you can remove someone from the background basically if you see a photo of someone jumping that was taken on a pixel phone beware magic editor may have been used to exaggerate things the tool is a lot of fun but does bring up a number of ethical questions when it comes to what is real and what is manipulated in photos especially if these photos are going to go online fortunately magic editor isn't perfect and I can usually tell a photo that I used it on versus one that I didn't since the way the AI creates the fill on the background is still just okay and sometimes it does take a few seconds for this effect or this tool to kick in maybe that will improve and there's one more magical tool I want to talk about what is this an apple review I kid I kid it's called audio Magic Eraser which I can use to clean up audio in videos I record for better Clarity all right I'm shooting this selfie video in the hotel lobby here at the Clancy hotel and I thought this would be a great way to test out the new audio Magic Eraser so here it is without the Magic Eraser applied and here it is with the magic Racer app do I sound batter can you hear me hear all the click clinks and other things going on in the background taken in total the pixel 8 has an outstanding camera system with a lot of features all of which are powered by Google's new tensor G3 chip Google's tensor chip has never been about Pure Performance horsepower instead it targets optimizing specific task and powering all those AI goodies now I've been using the pixel 8 for 4 days and I never ran into any performance issues now when I was downloading games and setting those up the phone did get warm but that was the only time the G3 chip along with Android 14 makes the pixel 8,394.16,621.843,230.47599999999997

CNET,2pQ_rOAKGbg,Phone,Google,slightly smaller at 6.2 inches compared to its predecessor's 6.3 inch screen the pixel 8 Pro still has a 6.7 inch display the screens are also brighter this time around which means they should be easier to see in direct sunlight they each run on a new version of Google's processor called the tensor G3 and just like older pixel phones the camera is a big deal on the pixel 8 and pixel 8 Pro the pixel 8 has a 50 megapixel main camera and a 12 megapixel Ultra wide camera similar to the pixel 7 but the main sensor is now more light sensitive according to Google which should result in better image quality the pixel 8 is also gaining a macro photography mode which was only previously available on the pro model Google saved its more dramatic camera upgrades for the pixel 8 Pro which has a,55.26,621.843,103.92
CNET,2pQ_rOAKGbg,Phone,Google,new 48 megapixel ultrawide camera accompanying the 50 megapixel main camera and 48 megapixel telephoto lens but one of the Pro's most interesting camera features won't be coming until later this year that's video boost which processes footage in the cloud rather than on the device to boost color grading generating videos that should look more professional both phones have a new editing tool called best take it works when you take multiple group photos in a row and allows you to change the expression on someone's face I tried this out in the short time I had with the pixel 8 and it worked instantly but it does feel a little unsettling to change the look on my face in a photo camera quality and screen size are usually the biggest things that separate the regular pixel from the pixel Pro but Google added something extra to the pro,107.46,621.843,94.91999999999999

CNET,zU0VJAntHMY,Phone,Google,foreign the pixel 7A is one of cnet's favorite budget smartphones it has the same processor as the pixel 7 and 7 Pro and a great camera all for less than five hundred dollars but three months later is it still a good pick the answer isn't so simple yes everything we liked about the pixel 7A when we reviewed it is still true but with the pixel 8 likely right around the corner and the pixel 7 seeing deep discounts there are some good reasons to think twice but first let's take a look at my Impressions I just Revisited the pixel 7A three months after reviewing it and here are my thoughts first using the pixel 7A again made me remember how much I really like its size it has a 6.1 inch screen which is smaller than the pixel 7s and therefore makes it easier to manage with one hand the other nice thing about having a smaller phone it actually kind of fits in my pocket,0.0,621.843,114.95999999999998
CNET,zU0VJAntHMY,Phone,Google,with larger phones it's a bit harder to really get it to fit completely it also has a really great 64 megapixel main camera that is technically a bit different than the pixel 7s for example Google says that the pixel 7's camera has a bigger sensor that's more sensitive to light but in my experience photos were very similar between the two phones if you really want a phone just for taking photos of family friends vacations pets that kind of a thing the pixel 7 or the pixel 7A will be just fine you're not really missing out on much by going through Google's smaller phone another thing I appreciated when returning to the pixel 7A is how Google updates its software over time now this isn't specific to the 7A Google releases updates for multiple pixel devices but it is a reminder of what you'll get with a pixel phone compared to a different Android phone Google released an update for the pixel lineup shortly after the,62.16,621.843,110.28
CNET,zU0VJAntHMY,Phone,Google,pixel 7A came out that update brought some more emergency and safety features as well as some new wallpapers and other updates one feature I've been playing around with is the new cinematic wallpaper which applies a 3D like effect to your 2D photos that makes the subject stand out from the foreground a bit more this was a lot of fun to play around with but I do have to say there are times when Google cropped it on the photo a little bit more than it should have which resulted in an image that looked a bit too awkward to have as your background wallpaper but still it was fun to play around with and it's a great example of how Google continues to update its pixel phones with new features over time now for the downsides even though I like the size of the pixel 7A screen it's just not bright enough to see Outdoors without cranking the brightness all the way up so right now I have the brightness about halfway and I,117.24,621.843,108.48
CNET,zU0VJAntHMY,Phone,Google,can barely see the screen it's not until I Really Turn it all the way up that I can actually see the display clearly and also battery life on the pixel 7A is just okay it's long enough to get me through a full day without worrying but I did notice just that battery life in my testing was almost on par with the Galaxy s23 lineup now on one hand that is impressive considering Samsung's phones are a lot more expensive than the pixel 7A but you also have to remember that Samsung's devices have brighter screens with higher refresh rates but the biggest downside to buying the pixel 7A right now comes down to timing Google just heavily discounted the pixel 7 bringing its price down to about the same as the pixel 7A and the pixel 7 has a bigger screen faster wireless charging and some extra features like reverse wireless charging which lets you charge other devices on the back of the phone and the action pan camera mode that said,171.66,621.843,112.86
CNET,zU0VJAntHMY,Phone,Google,there are still some reasons to consider the pixel 7A even though it's around the same price as the pixel 7 right now for one those who prefer smaller phones might still want the 7A instead and also since the 7A is newer you should get Android version updates for slightly longer than the pixel 7. it's also important to remember that the pixel 8 might be coming out soon since Google usually releases new pixel phones in October if you're not in a rush and can afford to wait you might want to see what the pixel 8 has in store of course we won't know until Google announces the phone but based on yours passed we can probably expect to see a new tensor processor and some camera improvements but it's also important to remember that if you wait too long you might miss buying the pixel 7 at its current discounted price so what do you think of the pixel 7A let me know in the comments and don't forget to keep following CNET for more pixel coverage thanks for watching and I'll see you next time,228.18,621.843,112.30000000000001

CNET,1djvUNW_lPM,Phone,Samsung,motion then there's the over-the-top generative edit tool similar to the pixel 8's magic editor and actually based on the same underlying technology this tool can delete objects and people from a photo and fill in the empty space where they were now I haven't seen a Flawless result as there's always some visible Remnant or Halo indicating that something is off I find the mundane photo fixes are actually the most useful and I can use the same generative edit tool to straighten photos now I enjoy leveling a photos Horizon hey my dad was an architect so yeah I'm that guy on most phones this usually means cropping in on the photo to get the desired straightened result now on the s24 and s24 plus generative edit can actually fill in the missing parts the edges of the photo beyond the original frame that weren't even there when I edited the photo and the results look good the gallery app has another trick I can swipe up to see a photo's metadata and little buttons and tags appear with recommendations to fix things nearly every photo seems to get a remaster tag which in my testing just means brightening the photo or parts of it the erased reflection fix works well enough now take a look at this photo I took of a tabletop Pac-Man game and notice the reflections across the glass I can tap erase Reflections and Bam the reflections are reduced uh they're they haven't gone away completely but results can sometime be hit or miss and the tool works well enough and should really be be called reduced Reflections instead on the whole the AI photo and video features feel more experimental than Dependable all three Galaxy phones have a Snapdragon 8 gen 3 chip which combined with 8 GB of RAM on the s24 and 12 GB of RAM on the s24 plus yielded py performance the unders screen fingerprint reader is blazing fast to unlock the camera app opens like a spring that's been sprung and gaming is fantastic with both phones handling everything from Mario Kart to Diablo Immortal to genin impact now the regular s24 did get warm to the touch faster than the s24 plus but neither became too hot to hold in Benchmark testing both phones are right up there with the s24 ultra the Asus Rog Phone 8 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max the s24 series runs on Android 14 and perhaps perhaps these,447.24,621.843,304.15999999999997
CNET,1djvUNW_lPM,Phone,Samsung,"sleeper feature on all of these phones is the fact that Samsung promises 7 years of major OS upgrades and software support that means you could be holding on to a Galaxy s24 until 2031 and still have an up-to-date version of Android on it though I I kind of have to imagine you might need a battery replacement before then like the screens the phone's batteries got bigger the s24 now has a 4,000 mAh battery while the s24 plus has a 4,900 mAh battery in everyday life this shows up in the s24 making it through a day on a single charge no problem in the week I had the s24 plus it lasted 2 days on a single charge twice ending the second day at 11% and 9% now we'll have to see where it's at after today and we're done filming so wait to the end of the video to find out also if you're enjoying this video please let us know but I want you to do something special look at your phone right now and write in the comments what percentage your phone's battery life is at thank you all right everybody here's my last checking at 7:30 p.m. we're about to leave high scores arcade here in Alam also first of all thank you Jonathan at high scores arcade for letting us film here so we started the day at 11:00 a.m. filming and the battery is at 97% we're ending the day at 7:30 p.m. and the battery is at 63% so keep in mind it's 8 and 1/2 hours we were filming the screen was on a full bright we're were playing video games I was taking photos I was shooting videos so a lot of heavy use in that time and the battery held in there like a champ so let me wrap up the video by throwing it back to me after days of testing the Galaxy s24 and s24 plus by playing games texting and calling in multiple languages taking photos recording videos and trying out all that Galaxy AI has to offer I'm happy to say that both of these phones are outstanding Samsung didn't reinvent the phone but it did take two great phones and make them better the challenge for the s24 plus is that Google's pixel 8 Pro has the same price and well slightly better cameras I do think the s24 plus is an overall better phone in nearly every other respect though even software which in my testing has been Rock Solid so this is my review I'm done now I'd like to hear from you guys make sure you put those B present in the comments and thank you for watching",599.16,621.843,308.238

CNET,umJbhJRe67I,Phone,Samsung,liked is the new 50 megapixel zoom camera which takes much crisper photos when you zoom in at 5x compared to the s23 ultra now as for what I didn't like this phone is expensive starting at $1300 this is one of the most expensive phones you can buy check out my review for all the full details,32.36,621.843,43.39999999999999
CNET,mEBbk38ENDA,Phone,Samsung,"this is the Galaxy s24 Ultra and it's all about [Music] AI when it comes to Samsung's new Galaxy phones especially the ultra It's usually the hardware that's the star of the show think of the 200 megapixel camera that debuted last year and the embedded S Pen that debuted on the s22 ultra just one year earlier but this year with the s24 things are different it's the software that's in the spotlight that's because the Galaxy s24 series are the first phones to launch with Galaxy AI a new set of features powered by generative AI which creates content in response to prompts based on training data that said I don't know if these features alone are worth upgrading for especially since these Galaxy AI features are available across all of Samsung's Galaxy s24 phones not just the super expensive Ultra which starts at $1,300 Sam Samsung has also said that Galaxy AI will come to the Galaxy s23 series as well which also kind of makes it hard to justify buying the s24 ultra but aside from Galaxy AI there are some other new things that are different with the s24 ultra compared to the s23 ultra for one it runs on qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 gen 3 processor it has a brighter screen and there's also a new 50 megapixel telephoto camera that offers crisper shots at a 5x Zoom here's what it's been like to use it for the last week Galaxy AI is by far the most interesting new thing about the Galaxy s24 series some of these features do feel familiar like generative edit for example which lets you erase or manipulate objects in photos that sounds very similar to Magic edit on the pixel 8 some of the other features like the ability to organize and summarize notes in Samsung's Notes app and the recorder app are also very familiar but part of that is intentional Samsung and Google worked together on these features for the Galaxy s24 so it seems like they're really embracing this partnership but on the other end that could make it harder for Samsung to make the s24 series stand out from Google's pixel 8 series but just because generative edit and Google's Magic edit are similar it doesn't mean they're exactly the same I tried using both on the same photo and the results were a little bit different I tried to erase a part of the blanket in the background Samsung kind of added a new blanket there to replace the one in the photo and Google kind of did something a little bit different it",0.52,621.843,299.487
CNET,mEBbk38ENDA,Phone,Samsung,looks a little bit like the same blanket that was already there but Google also gave me more options to choose from that I can just kind of swipe through of all of the Galaxy AI features I've been using I feel like language translation feels like the most unique Samsung has put language translation natively in its keyboard and in the phone app which means if you're texting someone or calling them and they speak a different language you don't have to hop between apps to translate or copy and paste text or anything like that I've been playing around with this a lot in the messages app and it's been working really quickly when I tried to translate it an entire text message thread between myself and my husband all it took was a few Taps to have the entire thread of our conversation translated with no copy and pasting required with phone calls it's similarly easy you just start a phone call like you normally would and then tap the chat assist button this did work well in my experience but it can be a little bit awkward and it can take a little bit of time to get used to basically the way this works is Samsung's AI is kind of acts as an intermediary and translates your speech and also translates the speech of the speaker on the other end so that the two of you can understand each other even though you're speaking different languages so even though it does work well it can be hard to know when it's your turn to start speaking because you do have to wait for Samsung's U AI translator to finish talking but I do think this could be really useful for people who travel a lot maybe for people who have family members that don't speak English or their native language or for people who need to communicate with work colleagues in different countries I do feel like it could be helpful so one of the most interesting new AI features is called Circle to search and Samsung is partnering with Google on this feature and basically just like the name implies you can Circle almost anything on your phone screen and it'll launch a Google search for whatever that item is so I just took a photo of the Tea House in this um so if I want to learn more about it after I've held that button down I can just draw a circle around it and as you can see almost instantly this little panel comes up and it brings up similar uh search results based on what I circled so Circle to search also works in apps so,155.239,621.843,268.92100000000005
CNET,mEBbk38ENDA,Phone,Samsung,if you see something on Instagram or another app and you want to know more about it or maybe where to buy it or something like that um you can just circle to search and it'll bring up some results once again I'm just going to hold that button and I'm going to draw a circle around this and sure enough there's a bunch of recipes for grilled cheese sandwiches and then here are some restaurants for places near me that serve grilled cheese sandwiches and even more videos another feature I really loved is called instant slowmo and just like the name implies you can can instantly turn any clip into a slow motion video just by pressing and holding on the footage and then just watching it slow down in real time and this isn't a game changer it's not a reason to upgrade your phone but I think it's just a a fun feature that's a nice application of uh Galaxy AI to the camera but not all Galaxy AI features are that useful there are some that I felt like I either wasn't really using very much or I feel like could use a little bit of work one is called chat assist so chat assist is kind of an umbrella term for different features that you can use when you're sending text messages one of them like I mentioned earlier is translation another one can rewrite your text messages in a different tone this is really similar to Google's uh Magic compose and again this is another feature that the two companies worked together on and I just don't really find myself using it and when I have used it I've noticed that it just doesn't sound like me which I guess is kind of the point now that's not necessarily a bad thing I could possibly see this being useful for times when maybe you want to text a coworker or a colleague and you want something that sounds a bit more formal than your normal language but um it's just something that I don't feel like is a game changer that impressed me nearly as much as the translation features and circle to search another thing I've noticed is in the notes app which can organize your notes into bullet points and summarize notes for you sometimes when I had a really long note like 1400 to 1500 words it had a hard time summarizing in it but my biggest complaint is that Samsung I feel has missed an opportunity here to put features on the s24 ultra that are specific to the s24 ultra these Galaxy AI features are not exclusive to the ultra you can get them on Samsung's,289.52,621.843,285.99899999999997
CNET,mEBbk38ENDA,Phone,Samsung,cheaper phones and while I am really happy that Samsung isn't making you pay top dollar to get access to Galaxy AI I really H that they would have thrown at least a couple of extra features in there that were just for the ultra the biggest thing that's different about the s24 ultra camera compared to last year's phone is the new 50 megapixel telephoto camera that camera offers what Samsung claims to be an optical 5x Zoom compared to the 10 megapixel 10x optical zoom that was on the s23 ultra so in practice I have noticed a difference although you do have to zoom in really close to tell I took this picture of some house plants at 5x zoom on both the s24 ultra and the s23 ultra and when I really zoomed in I could see that the s24 ultra did capture a good amount of detail more than the s23 ultra but again I did have to zoom in really closely to notice these difference in terms of general image quality the Galaxy s24 Ultra deals with different lighting conditions pretty well even dimly lit cocktail bars and areas like that and that's probably thanks to the larger new pixels that are in the s24 ultra compared to the s23 ultra even if the Galaxy s24 ultra's photo wasn't the brightest compared to the s23 ultra the iPhone 15 Pro Max or the Google pixel 8 Pro it did preserve a lot of detail which in general still resulted in a great overall photo I also think the Galaxy s24 Ultra did a better job of making skin tones and colors look a bit more natural than the Galaxy s23 Ultra now compared to the Google pixel 8 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro it's really hard to to tell which is the best camera phone because honestly all three phones have great cameras but they excel in different ways the Galaxy s24 Ultra for example is good at capturing detail in low light environments and has the most zooming options but the pixel 8 Pro also preserves a lot of detail when zooming and has generally better color and brightness in some scenarios in my opinion and the iPhone 15 Pro generally has the most accurate skin tone and colors in my opinion the Galaxy s24 Ultra looks a lot like last year's Galaxy s23 Ultra but with some subtle changes that become more obvious when you look closely first of all there's a new titanium design that gives it a bit of a different finish and it's also just ever so slightly lighter but the other change that I personally,435.24,621.843,298.91799999999995
CNET,mEBbk38ENDA,Phone,Samsung,"think is more significant is the new flatter edges the edges of this phone don't have that subtle curve that the Galaxy s23 Ultras have and the screen itself is also flatter around the edges which in my opinion makes it much easier to hold and just generally feels better in the hand like the s23 ultra the s24 ultra also has a 6.8 in screen but Samsung says it's much brighter this time around with a 2600 nit display however when I held it side by side next to the Galaxy s23 Ultra I couldn't really tell that much of a difference good news is that Samsung screens were already plenty bright so I'm sure in bright sunlight this will be even easier to see in the sun however I personally haven't seen a difference yet the Galaxy s24 Ultra has a 5,000 milliamp battery which is capable of lasting all day on a single charge but battery life will always vary depending on how you're using the phone on my first full day with the phone after about 15 and 1 12 hours of use it still had 69% of its battery left this was mostly during casual use but I did notice that when I started to process a lot of generative edits and use some of more of the language translation features and play games and things like that the battery life did drain a lot faster so it really does truly depend on how you're using your phone the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 gen 3 processor that powers the Galaxy s24 Ultra is generally quick and snappy language translations happen really quickly games like Devil May Cry peak of combat and Diablo Immortal ran just fine scrolling around the operating system feel smooth basically anything that you would expect of flagship phone to handle does happen pretty quickly The Only Exception is that generative edits can take a little bit of time to process but that relies on the cloud not so much the processor on its own despite Samsung's flashy new AI features the main reason to consider the ultra over the s24 plus and regular s24 comes down to the same things it always has the giant screen the extra camera and of course the S Pen at $1,300 the Galaxy s24 Ultra is hard to recommend unless you really care about those features and are willing to pay top dollar for them and again I do think Samsung kind of missed an opportunity here by not putting some more exclusive Galaxy AI features on the s24 ultra so what do you think of the s24 ultra let me know in the comments and don't forget to keep following CET for more Samsung coverage thanks for watching and I'll see you next time",591.959,621.843,304.59900000000005

Marques Brownlee,f3DfJxvkN-8,Earphone,Apple,[Music] all right I'll be honest I wasn't even planning on reviewing these you know it's Tech Timber there's there's a lot of stuff going on right now like there's other videos on other Tech that we're actively working on that's coming soon that you'll see so you know we saw the new airpods announcement in the keynote and the couple new features and then Apple sent over a pair it's got my memoji on it and everything I was like that's cute but I promise you I didn't even take it out the box for a few days because I was so busy working on some of the other stuff but then I did take it out the box and I did try them and I gotta say I I am now very convinced that these are really good but not by what you think so there's a lot of small new features here that airpods people have been waiting for for a long time on the surface it's still in a nearly identical design you recognize them from a mile away the only way you can tell them apart from the last airpods Pro visually is by these dual vents at the top but on the inside there is an entirely new driver and amplifier and these airpods do sound dramatically better than the last ones easily the best sounding earbuds Apple's ever made there are way more lows and mids so if you listen to Hip Hop or just music with a lot of bass it's very noticeable it's just way better and there's also very little high volume Distortion and just the whole sound profile is very responsive and crisp they sound good like really good earpods now there still is no lossless audio with these but it's still 16 bit 48 kilohertz audio and that is good but that wasn't the thing that convinced me it was a Difference Maker for sure it's really nice but that's not the thing these do now have a 33 longer battery life so it's six hours on a single charge now with noise cancellation on and up to 30 total hours with the battery in the case I promise you I'll never have earbuds in for six hours straight so this was more than enough for me but it wasn't what impressed me either there is also a new extra small ear tip so now it comes with the mediums installed by default and then there's two sizes smaller and one larger size so if you had smaller ears that the previous airpods didn't quite work with these may make a difference for you with the extra small ear tip as you can imagine that's not me mediums all the way but some maybe even tempted to say that the new case is the biggest,0.13,621.843,263.54800000000006
Marques Brownlee,f3DfJxvkN-8,Earphone,Apple,upgrade that's certainly what I thought when I watched the keynote it's like apple had a meeting about how wow people are losing these things and getting them mixed up with other people's airpods and then they just decided to do something about it so the case is the same size and shape but there's this lanyard loop on the side now in case you want to attach it to something it's kind of like the loop on the top of the water bottle at mkbhd.com but just way smaller and then you can use whatever language you want to attach it to but if that's not good enough for you there's a whole speaker at the bottom of the case now and it is surprisingly useful so it can play a loud sound to help you find them on top of the Precision finding that already works really well since it has a U1 chip inside so it's just like an air tag if it's somewhere in your general vicinity it can guide you to it that is sweet it also plays a sound when you get it on a charger wired or Wireless and the magsafe ring helps it stay in place on any magsafe wireless charging puck that's not new but it also now works with Apple watch Chargers too which is a nice touch on top of all that it is still ipx4 water resistant which is an extra layer of security if you work out and sweat around the case or if you end up in the rain in these and you can engrave it with your memoji now so your friends will never accidentally pick up your airpods case by mistake but not even that is what was convincing me about the airpods pro 2. not even the most requested feature apparently this is something lots of other earbuds have had but volume control on the earbud itself it's on the stock now so of course it is now much more convenient to just adjust the volume without having to reach for your phone it's kind of like this pinch gesture where you hold your finger on one side and then slide with the other on the flat spot on the stock it's kind of awkward at first but you do get used to it but no it was none of that the thing that convinced me with these headphones that they are incredible is the H2 chip so previous years generations of Apple headphones have had the H1 chip inside and it's this little chip that's doing the audio processing noise cancellation Etc this is the second generation of that chip and apple is bragging on stage that it has like a billion transistors or something ridiculous whatever the point of the chip is that it enables everything that is special about these,132.239,621.843,266.2219999999999
Marques Brownlee,f3DfJxvkN-8,Earphone,Apple,new airpods so first of all there is much improved active noise cancellation Apple said something like up to two times more background noise is removed versus the last generation I don't know about all that but combining these new drivers and the sound profile with the improved noise cancellation is definitely noticeable I mean it's incredible with white noise like air conditioners and transportation you put the headphones on and it just erases them immediately like I'm not the type of person to wear earbuds for an entire flight I still much prefer over-the-ear headphones for that but I get it with these now I understand why people would want to wear these earbuds on a plane because they cancel is that well I'm putting them on the same level of like the Sony mark IV earbuds and right below the new Bose quiet Comfort earbud twos and I put them above the airpods Maxes as far as how well it actually cancels sound I mean they still sound very different I did the back to back test don't get me wrong you can tell the much bigger driver makes a difference in the airpods max but these get quieter they remove more background noise now there is already a lot of computational audio happening in airpods Pro Sound they're literally adjusting the EQ with everything you listen to and across every different volume level to make sure they sound a certain way which is kind of funny it actually makes them hard to review sometimes against other headphones because every track hits a little bit different but the one huge Advantage airpods have had for a long time now over the competition over the poses and the Samsungs and the pixel buds of the world is the transparency mode as someone who has used them all like the transparency mode from airpods has for a while been on a level by itself Above the Rest the real-time pass-through of outside sound is kind of amazing and in these with the H2 chip it is leveled up again so on stage Apple introduced what they're calling adaptive transparency mode it's actually not a separate mode it's still the transparency mode which is with a different name but what's happening is it's still passing through all the outside sound but anytime there's a loud or a harsh sound above 85 decibels it cuts that sound down to not be loud and harsh so let's say you're walking or biking through the city you need to keep transparency mode on so you can hear the,265.32,621.843,272.0399999999999
Marques Brownlee,f3DfJxvkN-8,Earphone,Apple,cars and the people around you for safety but you're still listening to music or a podcast or whatever and then an ambulance drives past you Sirens blaring you will still hear the sirens but that super loud sound will be suppressed to a level that doesn't hurt your ears it's just it's super smart like and that ambulance could be anything that could be uh someone honking it could be a jackhammer construction noise it could be a dog barking but it's keeping it's keeping the same sound signature of whatever sound that is and just bringing it down below a certain level and it's doing it all in real time with virtually no DeLay So the crazy number is it's sampling outside sound 48 000 times per second apparently that's 240 times faster than the last generation and so it could even be like a really sharp like quick outside sound like a dog barking it will actually reduce a loud dog barking as fast as it's actually happening so by the time it reaches your ears it's a lower degree of sound it's crazy now I've been trying it I've been walking around with them and it's working really well it's so good that this is this is a real situation a scenario that I've dreamed up that I believe could happen I haven't tried this myself but you know how you typically go to a super loud concert and like front row middle row like the speakers are obviously too loud they're damaging your ears if you have an Apple Watch it's giving you like you know warnings that you if you're in this type of sound for too long it'll be damaging to your hearing instead of wearing earplugs you can actually you can really do this you can wear airpods Pro 2 and put them in transparency mode and it will take the entire sound signature of that whole thing you're listening to and it will drop it down to a reasonable level you'll still feel the bass in your chest of the speakers but your hearing won't be damaged as much because it's taking all of that and reducing it and you're still hearing the music that's incredible so all this real-time processing is happening on the earbuds not on your phone and that is the H2 chip at work plus there's also a few other features it enables too it talks to the noise app on the Apple watch in real time to show you how much noise is being canceled out in case you want a visual for that sort of thing and also if you accidentally ever put the wrong earbud in your case like someone else's,401.4,621.843,276.71900000000005
Marques Brownlee,f3DfJxvkN-8,Earphone,Apple,the speaker will actually play a chime and you'll get a mismatched airpods notification on your phone another nice touch for those people who have inevitably lost airpods to their friends cases and probably don't even know it and then there's a new ear scan for personalized spatial audio this was kind of a weird one so it's using the face ID depth sensors to measure your head and measure the depth of your ears to give you a personalized spatial audio mix Sony's been doing the same thing for a little bit with some of their headphones they use the front-facing camera I don't know if I was uh convinced that the usefulness of this I mean the spatial audio was already pretty good but after I did the personalized audio basically for me it just sounded like the Sound Stage got a little bit wider maybe like there's just a bit more of a spread to how far apart the different sounds and instrumentals are I don't know exactly how much of the ear scan data was being used for this but that's even more computational audio thanks to the H2 chip overall though these airpods are a significant upgrade and they're just flat out better than I expected I wasn't expecting this much of a change and they sound way better they work way better there is still lots of other competition in the in the earbuds World Samsung's buds are really good I also really like the pixel buds I did a whole separate video review of those if you want to watch it you can check it out with the card but at the beginning of the video I said a little phrase I don't know if you caught it but I said airpods people airpods people and this is something that you might see a lot if you live in a major city or where there's a lot of mass transit or something like that it's it's when people just wear air pods everywhere they go like they walk around the streets with them they bike around they just live with airpods in their ears and these are going to be amazing for those people like it's everything you'd care about it's the better battery life it's the better sound quality it's the better noise cancellation and much better transparency mode the better case the volume control on the stocks all in one package at the same price I get it I get it it's really good airpods Pro 2 really really good and now you know why all right that's it thanks for watching catch in the next one peace [Applause] [Music] [Applause],539.519,621.843,274.001
Marques Brownlee,xnPl9RPFLkE,Earphone,Apple,right these are both airpods Pro but these are the new airpods Pro you can kind of tell by the updated case I think one of the coolest things about this new,0.0,621.843,13.739

Marques Brownlee,xnPl9RPFLkE,Earphone,Apple,solid it actually lines itself up and that's because bring in the magnet paper there's a new array of magnets on the back of the case here to help it line up,25.74,621.843,22.679000000000002
Marques Brownlee,xnPl9RPFLkE,Earphone,Apple,which is super sick this is the old one you can see the headphones have little magnets in them but that's that's not the array that's what's sticking to the magsafe very cool,36.42,621.843,25.061
Marques Brownlee,LcI6F_GPwfE,Earphone,Apple,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here okay so i'm in the last stages of my macbook pro review a lot of you been asking where it is i'm not rushing it it is not early so sorry about that but uh my final bits of testing include editing a full mkbhd video shot in red code raw on the 16-inch m1 max macbook pro that's this video so if you're seeing this then that means at some point i got through that whole process so hopefully that went well if it didn't go well then check my twitter because that's probably where i was complaining about how things went uh either way that's next up until then these are the most popular headphones on earth these are airpods so the newest update you're looking at here is airpods 3. they were a quieter announcement at last month's apple event but they're 179 and honestly the story with these is well there's quite a bit of new stuff but also the competitive landscape for earbuds has been heating up for years and there have never been more high quality alternatives to airpods than there are right now so the new airpods 3 design basically looks just like a set of airpods pro but without the silicon tips like someone chopped them off it's a the one size fits all hard tip from the air pods of the past and this is simultaneously its biggest advantage and its biggest downside for people like me see the shape is just slightly adjusted from previous hard-tipped airpods you can see it's more of a wedge shape where it goes into your ear it's a slightly bigger opening at the end and it's a bit more of a larger bulb but basically the idea is that it's pretty close to the common ear and it just pops in and sits there no problem at least it's supposed to for most people but for me again it's not the best fit the left one happens to stay in pretty well but then the right ones constantly feeling like it's slowly sliding out of my ear and eventually it just falls out if i'm not constantly adjusting it so it's pretty annoying clearly not for me and for that reason i still prefer silicon tips instead of hard plastic i am super jealous of all you people who just grab air pods and just put them in your ears and they just stay forever and just run around um i'm not one of those people oh well but i did test these for a little bit and,0.0,621.843,263.67
Marques Brownlee,LcI6F_GPwfE,Earphone,Apple,there are some other new things aside from just the new design so there's the controls on the stem now on both sides like airpods pro you pretty quickly get used to squeezing it to play and pause you can double tap to go to the next song etc there's no noise cancellation in these but you can see the mesh cutout on the back and around all the mics all around this thing for adaptive eq it passes through some of the sound from the outside mainly to feel a bit more open than some other earbuds they are sweat and water resistant now so if you want to work out in them you might have already done it but they'll officially be fine now and also if you walk around in the rain no problem and there's also a new horizontal case looks just like the airpods pro case but it's a little bit smaller and for the first time the case is also officially ipx4 water resistant so like they might have survived water in the past but it's officially official now still lightning at the bottom unfortunately but this new case is now improved it'll still do wireless charging but it's also now magsafe compatible which just means it'll snap onto the iphone's magsafe charging puck and it holds pretty well there too this magsafe wireless charging case isn't unique to airpods 3 though by the way they quietly also updated the airpods pro case to also snap onto the magnets but they didn't also update it for water resistance so small difference what would have been even cooler is if you could trickle charge them via the qi charging on the back of the iphone since they're both qi charging it would have been the sickest like little ecosystem plug they could have called it reverse mag safe charging but there they don't talk to each other like that it needs some extra hardware to reverse wireless charge iphones don't have that so that's not a real feature in this product like it is with some other phones and their earbuds now if you decide to grab the sexiest case on earth the dbrand icons case or pretty much any other airpods case no magnetic snapping but yes wireless charging does still work if you're wondering i'll have a link below to this case if you want to protect your headphones and make sure you get an airpods 3k specifically because like i said airpods pro cases are slightly different dimensions they won't quite fit but really the most interesting change,133.84,621.843,256.08
Marques Brownlee,LcI6F_GPwfE,Earphone,Apple,to airpods honestly is the sound they have a and i can't believe i'm saying this a perfectly respectable sound now so it's legitimately very improved i've trashed on airpods in the past as you guys have probably remembered for how weak they sound how tiny they've been these airpods when they're sat right in your ears have much more body and bass frequencies now and they get plenty loud as always and they really do sound pretty solid now the caveat is one there is no eq built in like a lot of other headphones have and two these were meant to still be good basic everyday headphones and so apple has tuned them as such meaning they've got to be usable for phone calls and podcasts which have a lot of high focus on vocal frequencies but also music listening in a variety of genres and then also movie watching and everything in between but one feature that sort of gets highlighted at least every time apple talks about these headphones is spatial audio now i don't typically use spatial audio very much but every time i try these i give them another shot and basically there are two types of spatial audio experiences so one is if you're just listening to music or watching a video and you can just force it on with the ios settings and the head tracking turns on and for most mixes it basically sounds like you're suddenly in a small room with a set of speakers in front of you and as you turn your head from left to right those speakers will sound like they continue to stay in front of you but then two there's a very small number of really well done mixes in dolby atmos and you can find some on apple music they actually do a great job of separating the instruments and the channels and sort of spreading them out around you and this whole symphony with a decent sound stage and the airpods do a good job of letting you kind of place the instruments and vocals around you in space around your head but i find that to be a pretty rare experience if you get to listen to these listen to uh blessings by big sean that's one really good example but again these types of tracks are few and far between but ultimately the sound,262.0,621.843,258.15999999999997
Marques Brownlee,LcI6F_GPwfE,Earphone,Apple,for me comes down to the hard tipped plastic they do sound much much better but unfortunately i have one of the cursed ears that doesn't work with hard-tipped earbuds so i would take silicon tipped earbuds every single time some people are the total other way around so there's a lot of people comparing airpods pro with airpods 3. i would personally pay the extra money for airpods pro also right now if you check on amazon airpods pro have been like 190 bucks for a while and this is the new version too with the updated case so it's like 10 extra dollars to get the noise cancellation and the silicon tips i'm picking that every single time but for some people who don't care about that type of thing this is what they'll pick but that's really the summary for these headphones they don't really do any one thing amazingly meaning they'll get beat in certain single categories but they do everything you'd want headphones to do daily very well they have a slightly longer but totally reasonable six hour battery life they have an all-around good tune that's not adjustable they have a small case that wireless charges and they fit great in the iphone's ecosystem they instantly pair with the rest of your icloud devices and seamlessly switch between them and they have better find my ability now so if you lose the case which i don't know how many people lose just the case but if you do you can use find my to track that down it's not nearly as super precise as air tags but it's very convenient to get a notification on your iphone if you start to leave somewhere and you realize you left your airpods behind but look at the whole rest of the landscape it's way more diverse and interesting now beats fit pro just came out today these have the best in-ear fit of any earbud i've ever worn wing tip for the win they're amazing for working out they have noise cancellation but they have a kind of a still clunky case that also doesn't have wireless charging or check these these are the sony wf-1000xm4 these also blow the airpods out of the water in terms of sound quality but if you've ever worn these i mean they're much bigger and don't really sit,391.28,621.843,257.83900000000006
Marques Brownlee,LcI6F_GPwfE,Earphone,Apple,in the ear as comfortably and you wouldn't work out in these and they're 250 dollars so they're in a different price category there's also the nothing earbuds that i reviewed which have a better battery life but also a pretty big case that does wireless charge and it's a more interesting distinctive design especially with the buzz that i really like but they don't fit as well in the ios ecosystem and then there's also samsung's buds too which have a lot of the same stuff and wireless charging but you get the idea there's a lot out there so air pods are meant to sit right in the middle of the road like that's they don't do any of the things amazingly in any one category but they do everything pretty well and that's what makes them so easy to recommend it's also they came out right before the holiday season like they know i i'm probably gonna end up getting these as a gift for some people they're incredibly popular for that exact reason but here's a fun fact airpods if you just cut off airpods from apple and just made it its own separate company airpods inc that company would be worth about 175 billion dollars that's from an estimate from back in 2019 just looking at how many they're selling approaching 100 million units tons of revenue obviously but can you imagine just a headphone company by itself with only like three models being worth 175 billion dollars like just for some context logitech which makes lots of headphones but also plenty of other accessories is worth 14 billion dollars sony which makes headphones but a ton of other stuff they make movies they make the playstation they make phones and cameras sony's worth like 150 billion dollars tops right now so that's that's not to say these headphones are amazing but that's to say they are probably the best lure to bring people into the iphone ecosystem and they're all around extremely convenient they're the easy choice so there you have it thanks for watching hopefully the macbook pro isn't exploding exporting this video catch you guys soon with that review but until the next one it's techvember that doesn't roll off the tongue as well see you guys next video peace,519.76,621.843,260.319
Marques Brownlee,Gvvo6vUpJRc,Earphone,Apple,[Music] so [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here i figured it out i got it i understand airpods max now now it took me a couple days of listening and comparing and taking notes but i got it so the original question when these headphones were surprise announced was why is apple making 550 dollar wireless noise canceling headphones they better either sound incredible or have some kind of unreal feature to be worth that much over all the other headphones that we already know are good right well here's my take on where these fall so there's actually two types of high-end headphones right the first would be like reference type like studio grade actual production headphones so these are going to be lightweight they're going to have a super flat sound signature you're going to wear them for hours and hours on end and you often need extra hardware like a mini preamp or something like that to drive them they are geared for production and then on the other side there's just luxury listening there's just nice headphones that sound great for music and and podcasts and movies and and all kinds of consumer oriented features so you might have noise cancellation they might be wireless that's the other type they're geared for consumption so now this new pair of very expensive headphones i'm glad they didn't call them airpods studio because they land squarely in that second section of luxury listening and it was kind of confusing to pin them there at first because they do have a bunch of features and a bunch of really weird quirks that actually kind of resemble the other world i'll talk about those in a minute but fact is these headphones check a set of boxes that no other set of headphones i've ever tested can claim to check it's a really odd combination of pieces here but let's just start with the design right off the bat it's metal so these headphones have aluminum ear cups that get cold to the touch when you're outside in the winter and stainless steel headband frame here and so right away they've already started to differentiate themselves because virtually every other pair of high-end headphones or really any headphones out there are made of plastic but this metal build is dope it's got super tight tolerances the ear cups are even this like satin finish which i think would look even better as matte black apple why'd you send me the green one and the telescoping headband doesn't have notches but it's really smooth and it takes a lot of pull to move so it feels high quality too and the button and the digital crown up top are super nice they feel really high quality so if the metal build is so great why are these like the only pair of headphones doing the metal thing why are the rest of them all plastic well turns out the reason you don't see metal headphones very much is because all these other headphone companies have done the research and one of the primary factors for comfort for wearing headphones for a long time is their weight and,3.75,621.843,378.9680000000001
Marques Brownlee,Gvvo6vUpJRc,Earphone,Apple,metal is heavy much heavier than plastic so they've all realized that and they've all done plastic headphones because that's so much more comfortable to wear for a long time so this is something airpods macs have to work around so they do their best with this really thin flexible mesh in the top band that's supposed to sort of evenly distribute some of the weight on top of your head but there's no getting around that these are heavy headphones it's kind of like driving an electric car if you keep it in a straight line you can forget that it's heavy but as soon as you hit a corner you remember it's a heavy car and so for me if i sit still with these headphones for a while i totally forget the weight they just kind of sit on my head like a pillow but the second i nod my head or stand up to look at something or look up i remember they're quite heavy for the numbers people about 380 something grams versus 250 ish grams but you know what these do a pretty great job with the metal compared to how it could have been i have exactly one other pair of headphones that's made completely of metal and it's these remember these these are the beats pros 400 bucks all metal headphones and they bragged about how they're all metal and these did a terrible job with it these weigh 450 grams or something like that they're way heavier and they're about the least comfortable pair of headphones i've ever worn they pinch you right on the right underneath your ear they're on ear for some reason instead of over ear harsh they're brutal they squeeze your head like a lot unless your head is shaped like this which it's not so yeah it could have been a lot worse but then some other quick design notes there is no apple logo anywhere on these headphones so the design is actually it's actually kind of grown on me over the past few days it looks pretty clean and like i said matte black would look pretty sweet and also you should know there's no sweat or water resistance here so if you're an athlete or if you're looking to make these your gym headphones you want to walk around the city while it's raining or snowing or something like that probably reconsider apple went with over-ear headphones here instead of on-ear and i definitely prefer this the mesh ear cups with memory foam are nice and soft and very comfortable and through long listening sessions they've actually done better than leather i listen to more than two three hours in a row before my ears start to get hot and i needed a break which is pretty great and the ear cups are removable easily with magnets now this is a quirk you pretty much never see in consumer headphones but the fact is you really should be somewhat regularly replacing the actual ear cup part of your headphones that you keep for a long time but most people never do but here it makes sense you know these are going to be metal headphones that will hopefully last you a long time many many years of use but this piece that you want to stay the same will eventually compress and start to crack and get old and faded you get a new pair it keeps the driver the same distance from your ear all that,206.08,621.843,341.20099999999996
Marques Brownlee,Gvvo6vUpJRc,Earphone,Apple,good stuff just by replacing it now apple's going to sell you replacements for 69 bucks which is definitely overpriced there's no way they're worth that much money but i got to give them credit for the system here at least they're easy to replace and you can mix and match colors if you want to the lack of touch controls i think were a good call here on the airpods max apple added a larger version of that digital crown from the apple watch up top but basically it's just a fancy knob that you rotate for volume and press for media controls and it works great it's got really satisfying clicks and you can reverse the direction of the spin in ios software if you want to but alright marquez they cost 550 they better sound like god himself whispering in my ear for that much money how do they sound well they sound like luxury listening which is to say really really good now listen i'm gonna preface this by saying i'm not an audiophile like probably every other review at this time but i've listened to a lot of headphones at this point i know what i like and these sound really good airpods macs have these big 40 millimeter drivers behind those earcups and they sound excellent super clear at all volumes i was impressed by the ultra low distortion at high volumes too and they do get loud enough that i should never need to listen at 100 volume i max out at probably 75 to 85 percent you obviously approach the limits of how good things can sound over wireless when you're just listening to streaming services and bluetooth but with high quality spotify streaming quality i'm loving this solid punchy bass and even a little deep sub bass once in a while the instrument separation is great and the clarity through mids and highs in a variety of genres is great not fatiguing at all to listen to now if you're sitting and watching this video and thinking well okay what about some nice higher bitrate local files these headphones already aren't for you like at that level that you're talking about you probably want you you end up getting some extra hardware so a nice preamp with some nice clean gain to power some wired headphones probably open back and some nice single source audio files with high bit rate and by the time you get through all of that that's a very different level of commitment and work than someone who just wants to grab some wireless headphones so you would be getting some extra quality that you could hear out of that setup sure but people listening these headphones are i'm gonna be totally honest listening to spotify and apple music and maybe title but also some soundcloud and youtube and some some podcasts and watching some movies so the sound quality is fantastic for that the noise cancellation is also excellent now this i kind of saw coming but these nine microphones on here do a fantastic job with white noise and with a surprisingly natural sound to it sometimes noise-canceling headphones can feel like there's a bit of a pressure and they sound a little bit unnatural with it on i found that these didn't do much of that whether it's because of the mesh or,376.88,621.843,363.35999999999984
Marques Brownlee,Gvvo6vUpJRc,Earphone,Apple,the pass-throughs or the mics whatever it's all awesome and obviously i haven't gotten to fly with these yet but it absolutely cancelled out a vacuum cleaner like three feet away from my head so i'm gonna put these right up as matching the sony xm4s as kings of noise cancellation and they should be great on a plane and these headphones also have the best transparency mode i've ever heard and you know obviously other noise canceling headphones will do this they'll have a mode where you can let ambient sound through so you can hear your environment someone calls you or someone your bus stop gets read out loud or something like that but these for whatever reason are incredible i can hear everything but not just what things are being said but where they're coming from or some things to my right to my left in front of me behind me a lot of other headphones have an ambient mode these are the king of that so all of that translates to these being fun to listen to there's no latency or range issues anywhere with bluetooth so i'm able to walk around corners and even up and down stairs away from my device without a drop connection and also you might be wondering how the audio would sound with these nine microphones picking up your voice and cancelling out the background noise so this is how it would sound it's fine there's not a lot of background noise even this time but if you're on a zoom call or a facetime and these are your microphone is what you're gonna get all right we gotta talk about this case this stupid case i hate everything about this i hate the way it looks i hate these sloppy kind of pointless slots across the bottom i hate that the lightning port doesn't quite line up at the bottom in that notch cutout i hate that they're annoying to take the headphones out of quickly and they're annoying to put the headphones back into i hate that the magnet is kind of small in the lip and it's kind of easy to miss sometimes and it's not as satisfying to slap it shut i hate that it doesn't protect easily the most delicate part of the headphones that needs protection that mesh headband i hate that it looks like a mini purse and i hate that i know apple thoroughly considered all this stuff i hate that there's no off button on these headphones and that it requires you to put them in this stupid case to trigger the low power mode so it doesn't just burn through battery all the time now don't get me wrong the battery life on these headphones is fine they do reach the advertised i would say 16 to 20 hours even with noise cancellation on and you can plug them in for five minutes and get an hour and a half of extra listening so the battery is not a problem but this case is so stupid it's just this it's just a weird choice very apple-like choice to to lock you into their magical solution for they turn on and they just work when you want them to because now you have to use this case like if i don't want to use this case when they sit out they drain battery at about the same rate as when they're on and playing music whether,558.8,621.843,348.88000000000005
Marques Brownlee,Gvvo6vUpJRc,Earphone,Apple,they are playing or not even though they know they're not on your head and they'll do that for about two hours staying ready to go until they automatically go into low power mode but aside from that dumb case there's plenty of smart features built in here the sensors inside will know if they're on your head or not and will auto play pause when you take them off and put them back on you can hold that digital crown you can talk to siri all you want she'll read out your text messages and talk to you and of course all the awesomeness of airpods pairing to every apple device you have instantly is still pretty sweet so you can quickly switch between your mac your iphone and your ipad if you have one solid and then some last little housekeeping stuff from those of you who left comments on the impressions video what you wanted to know uh can you use these with android just as normal bluetooth headphones yes you can but at this point you're cutting off a lot of the smart features so seems not worth it how's the bleed they do bleed a little bit so if you've got these up at say 75 85 volume or higher people around you can actually hear what you're listening to and do they still work when the battery is dead if they're plugged in yes they do but at the end of the day this all comes down to what you want headphones to do so like i mentioned at the beginning of this video there's a separate section of high-end headphones that are reference grade professional production headphones and you could use these for that but i personally wouldn't i mean these are not flat uh you can't turn adaptive eq off you can't turn the colorful sound off and it just doesn't have the production stuff built in they're not wired they're not open back they're just they're not really for that but what these are meant to do is deliver a great listening experience and with their awesome sound quality they do and with their sweet noise cancellation they do with their pretty cool spatial audio experience which only works with iphones and ipads for now but is basically the same as uh airpods pro it'll pick up on 7.1 and dolby atmos sound sources and will sort of respond to your head placement based on where you're at it's awesome for movies that is so great as a listening experience the wireless connection great for listening i mean all the stuff that they've built in the the play pause stuff all the volume controls it's so that it's a better listening experience and they do all this stuff with just a few gigantic quirks sort of like a top three giant quirks which are the stupid case the metal build which is a bit heavy and that price tag but if you are okay with those three things and especially if you're in apple's ecosystem like we've talked about so many times well then these are pretty dope headphones sounds kind of like a lot of other apple products right either way that's been it airpods max review hope you enjoyed it's kind of tech sember at this rate isn't it lots of stuff coming up lots of stuff in the back burners catch you guys very soon in the next video peace,733.36,621.843,376.558
Marques Brownlee,UdfSrJvqY_E,Earphone,Apple,all right what's up mkbhd here so we got a little surprise little quiet but not so quiet addition to apple's holiday season stuff a little one more thing on top of there one more thing so they've added to their headphone lineup and there's a new pair of over ear wireless noise cancelling apple headphones and they're called air pods max and they cost 550 dollars and i got them right here now i didn't really know what to make of the name right off the bat i don't think i would have named them airpods personally but hey if you look at the rest of apple's lineup i guess all of their audio products have pod in them there's ear pods air pods home pods so fine either way this is the box and it's a pretty big box for a pair of headphones but you can see we have this minty green color here today to get into when you pop that top get into the top of the box first thing you see is the headphones inside already inside the smart case because they don't fold they don't pack down at all this is how you travel with them this is how they ship in this case with the bands as a handle but we'll get to that in a minute i'm just gonna take them out of the case for the first time and the metal of the headphones is actually legit cold to the touch which is pretty sweet not gonna lie i can get the paper off of the smart case so we can admire that too in all of its uh glory anyway not much else in the box you get a little bit of paperwork no apple stickers and there is one cable but not the typical cable that comes with headphones no this is a usb type-c to lightning cable there is no brick and this is purely for charging and there's no audio cable included that'll be another 35 bucks from apple.com but yeah there you have the headphones pretty unique uh they look like those huge planar magnetic headphones from back in the day but like a modernized version of that design i guess it's kind of classic this green here probably isn't the best looking color if i'm being real but that's it we can get it back into the smart case slap that magnet shut and we're off to the races [Music] so it turns out there is a lot of really interesting stuff with this particular pair of headphones i mean you guys have seen headphones before i've reviewed them but there's a lot that's different a lot that's unique about these that you don't,3.36,621.843,292.87999999999994
Marques Brownlee,UdfSrJvqY_E,Earphone,Apple,really see very often and so while this isn't my review uh that'll be coming up soon and definitely make sure you subscribe to be among the first to see that if you haven't already uh this is just gonna be my first impressions and the top five things you should know about these new airpods so number one the materials like i said when i took it out the box the metal was cold to the touch so these have a stainless steel flexible frame and the ear cups i was touching are aluminum there's these shiny telescoping arms and ball head joints on the ear cups that let them move around a little over 90 degrees overall there is no doubt these are built very well there's no creaks no gaps anywhere i mean even the little slide to expand the headphones is really satisfying because there's a lot of resistance and i think i actually like this more than the typical plastic clicks to expand but really the materials aren't actually as important as the overall comfort and these are going to sit on top of the head pretty nice that mesh band at the top is basically designed to distribute the weight as evenly as possible across your head and be kind of breathable and it is really soft which is awesome but we'll see about durability long term i think it's probably worth it though because with all this metal they are heavy headphones they come in at a hefty 386 grams compared to the much lighter 250 grams of my sony xm4s but yeah i mean as far as just high-grade headphones go aside from this one's particular lack of sweat or water resistance it just doesn't get much better built than this that's just facts by the way the color options same as the ipad air so black silver light blue pink and this sort of minty green all right number two the ear cups magnetic so they just pop off pretty easily they do stay on really well in their sort of groove when you're wearing them and obviously most of the time they don't just flop off but when you really do pull them to take them off they come off and that's actually really smart because most people should replace the ear cups on their headphones every once in a while the metal part the outside that's designed to last a long time but the inside especially with softer materials and leathers you see that a lot people sort of outgrow the ear pad and then just buy,152.64,621.843,269.6789999999999
Marques Brownlee,UdfSrJvqY_E,Earphone,Apple,new headphones so this is a good idea now apple is very happy to sell you some new ear pads for sixty a set but uh i guess a nice bonus at least is that you can actually mix and match colors if you want to would have been nice if you could customize your cushion color straight from the order page and mac rumors even put together a little visual aid so you can see what the different color combos look like but that's just the most apple thing you've ever heard isn't it buying 550 headphones and having to spend an extra 70 dollars to change part of the color but number three is the controls so there are no touch controls anywhere on the sides of either of the earcups as there are with a lot of other wireless headphones instead they borrow the digital crown from the apple watch plus there's an extra noise cancellation button just to go on or off with transparency or noise cancellation i might have preferred to see these buttons at the bottom of the ear cups for better reachability but overall this is probably honestly better than a lot of the finicky touch controls i like when there's a physical control like on microsoft's headphones having that big dial spinning that was sweet too so here on the apple headphones you can spin that digital crown for volume you can tap it in to answer calls or double tap to go forward triple tap to go back etc and also in ios 14.3 when you update there's uh controls and support built in that let you reverse the scrolling direction for the crown in case you end up getting it backwards then number four the case so uh let's just get the jokes out of the way right off the top shall we it looks like a purse that doesn't really hold much and it looks like a bra like no way around it but for real this is a super strange case to me so they call it the smart case it comes with the headphones and the headphones literally just slot in here and close with a magnet and my very first impression is there is no redeeming quality about this case at all the headphones don't actually fold down or get more compact to travel with the most durable part of the headphone is covered and the softest least durable part is your carrying strap it's the most exposed part and then it isn't even fully protect all of it there's like slots in here i understand you can charge here if you want to plug them in via lightning but,287.52,621.843,281.12000000000006
Marques Brownlee,UdfSrJvqY_E,Earphone,Apple,what is all this what this this case is weird and then also something to note there is no on off button with these headphones so instead you put them in this case and when the magnet shuts it detects that they're in the case and they go okay we don't need to be on anymore it goes into this ultra low power state to save battery and that's cool that's really smart and that means you don't have to remember to turn them off every time and as soon as you take them out the case they wake up and it's like you never turn them off easy but now that means you have to use this case to turn the headphones off and if you don't use this case they will just sit around draining battery for about two hours before they go into auto low power mode not sure if other cases can be made that also use magnets to trigger this low power mode that remains to be seen but then number five last but not least is the smart features so this is the part that's going to require the most additional testing for me because basically aside from sound quality which first impression is very good and noise cancellation is right about on par with airpods pro basically they're incredibly good with white noise but there's a lot more testing for this sort of thing for the full review and there's a lot of smart features too there's the dual h1 chips doing a lot of computing as you listen to music one in each ear there's nine microphones this time for noise cancellation and transparency mode and they're of course apple headphones made to be used with iphones and apple products so when you use it with an iphone you get features like audio sharing siri you're reading your text messages and the instant pairing and all that fun stuff but like i said i'm going to get super into this and the audio quality and in-depth thoughts on all this stuff in the full review this is just the impression and there's a lot of testing to be done but at the end of the day you know what's the hardest part for me about these is i i don't really know what exactly to compare them to like of course i plan on putting them through the ringer and and very thoroughly testing them because at 550 dollars they deserve that and you deserve that but i guess i want to hear from you in the comments section what you specifically want to know about these headphones what do you care about with headphones like this like my natural instinct as you probably saw on twitter was to compare them to,427.599,621.843,271.761
Marques Brownlee,UdfSrJvqY_E,Earphone,Apple,my precious my i mean a lot of people's favorite wireless headphones ever which is the sony's and the xm4s they're basically the top of the line industry favorite noise canceling wireless headphones and as you know those headphones have the absolute best noise cancellation i've ever heard they're lightweight and comfortable they have a longer 30 hour battery life they actually fold for travel they come with a real protective case they come with an audio cable and they're 200 less at their absolute maximum of 350 bucks but you can already find them for less than that so by that logic at least on paper sony's headphones absolutely beat apple's headphones in pretty much every metric right but i feel like a lot of people aren't going to use that as a comparison interestingly enough maybe maybe it's like the pro display xdr where you have to compare it to the super ultra high end reference grade stuff to appreciate it so if i'm comparing it to my two thousand four hundred dollar sennheiser headphones that i've edited with maybe this is a lighter weight wireless smaller cheaper version of that that works with more devices maybe that's the comparison or maybe it is somewhere in the middle with like you know the sennheiser hd 650 or even the drop thx panda headphones somewhere in that high-end audio file range except now it's just apple's entry into that space it's hard to say but at the end of the day if you're here from my take for my first impression i have listened to these for a couple hours now and they sound really good but do they sound 550 good i mean you're starting to approach the limits of wireless audio so tbd um they are built extremely well but does that alone make them worth 550 dollars not really um they of course have all apple smart features and i don't think that by itself is going to make you buy headphones that expensive but maybe all of this stuff combined maybe just maybe all that put together well there's an audience for it because they're sold out already but either way i hope to find that out all in the full review this has just been my first look first impressions of airpods max a weird name i'm not going to get used to saying that for a while but again let me know what you think what you want to know about these headphones thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,563.44,621.843,289.84000000000003
Marques Brownlee,zHAB4qDsgKY,Earphone,Apple,[Music] all right it's 2020 and it's impossible to ignore why are so many companies copying air pods so about four years ago in 2016 Apple got on stage and announced the iPhone 7 to the world which was the first iPhone ever with courageously no headphone jack and during that same presentation on the same stage 27 minutes later they unveiled their newest creation air pods a pair of completely wireless headphones one earbud in each ear in this convenient magnetic case that pairs instantly with the iPhone and solves everyone's headphone jack problem see on stage they explained that if they want to get to their vision of this totally Wireless future where we don't need cables or cords anymore they have to get rid of the headphone jack and eventually all the other rest of the ports like the Lightning port - in theory so this was the first brave courageous step towards that future but it really comes down to one word courage the courage to move on do something new that betters all of us but what they had also actually just conveniently rediscovered was that selling people the solution to a problem that you just created a half an hour earlier was a brilliant way to make a ton of money on top of already making a ton of money like it's no secret that Apple makes most of its profit from the iPhone and then things connected to the iPhone we've talked about the ecosystem before they're smart they've made services like iCloud Drive Apple pay Apple care all these things that capitalize on the massive customer base that is the iPhone to make significantly more money from it it's a smart business so this isn't a new concept for Apple we're just now adding dongles and wireless headphones to that list but of course it doesn't,0.76,621.843,210.94000000000003
Marques Brownlee,zHAB4qDsgKY,Earphone,Apple,all work unless it's at least a pretty good product and it was people love air pods they were definitely not the first wireless earbuds ever but the combination of the convenience and the little case they came in and putting them right next to the iPhone and of course how well they worked with it instant pairing that whole thing made them an instant hit and of course they were the number one selling headphones in the world a year later and so now today it's estimated that with air pods - and now air pods Pro and the world charger and with the tens of millions of sales Apple has made around eight billion dollars from air pods eight billion dollars that might not sound like a huge percentage of Apple's business because it's not but just for some perspective if you broke that off into a separate company and incorporated a new head phone company air pods Inc separate from Apple that company's revenues by itself would be enough to be a fortune 500 company and probably somewhere in the middle of the pack more than the bottom two or three hundred of those and plus they're expected to jump up again in 2020 as iPhone 5s and iPhone 6 owners continue to upgrade and the headphone jack continues to disappear so now as air pod sales are taking off and going to orbit a lot of the companies that were ridiculing Apple for getting rid of the headphone jack along with you and me well they took a look at this again and saw that they kind of wanted a piece of that pie like this would be a silly business decision not to get involved in this huge new market that's basically being created in front of their eyes so they did the same thing Google well they made a commercial calling out the headphone jack a year after Apple got rid of theirs,109.96,621.843,193.81100000000004
Marques Brownlee,zHAB4qDsgKY,Earphone,Apple,then literally the next pixel that came out had no headphone jack and hey what do you know Google pixel buds now exists oneplus has been known to take their occasional jabs at Apple they made their remarks but two years after Apple their new one +60 had no headphone jack and their new wireless bullets headphones appeared as a convenient solution Huawei flagships don't have headphone jacks anymore either but they'll gladly sell you their new Huawei free buds to set you free of wires razors phones also don't have headphone jacks but you'll see their new hammerheads wireless earbuds I feel like I've seen that shape before Amazon will sell you echo buds Microsoft has announced their surface buds even the essential phone from a company that popped up on the map for one year and made one phone with no headphone jack also happened to make a hundred and fifty dollar attachable HD headphone jack adapter that is still listed on their site to this day it actually has nothing to do with air pod clones that's that's just funny but even Samsung has been one of the last major holdouts with a headphone jack in the Galaxy S but sure enough they got rid of that headphone jack on the Galaxy Note 10 and the S 20 I'm afraid to say it but that's next and they've been pushing galaxy buds that conveniently charge right on the back of the phone that you obviously got them for and all these are various different prices and have slightly different form factors and feature sets to differentiate them but they all basically do the same thing which is solve a problem that was just created the headphone jack is quickly disappearing it's becoming like an enthusiast feature and you see headlines,206.43,621.843,181.83
Marques Brownlee,zHAB4qDsgKY,Earphone,Apple,about when a new headphone jack is included in a phone because it's sort of a noteworthy thing to see that again and of course you now see pretty much every major headphone company in the world scrambling to make their best wireless earbuds to also compete here so Audio Technica makes a pair Sony makes a pair I just got back from CES where I saw TCL is making a pair this is it's got the connection button on the back and flips open like that and there's magnets that hold the earbuds in like this is there air pause competitor even these companies that don't have a smart phone to connect it to are just trying to sell you something that you'd reasonably consider buying over air pods for some reason because this is a PI they got to get it on and then on top of all that there's the whole world of air pods clones and if you're thinking no no wait a minute these aren't clones they're all you know they have their differentiating features and they're slightly different no I'm talking about the ones that literally try to make themselves look exactly like air pods in an effort to basically convince you that you're getting the same thing for less money these are the ones that are not so well intentioned you might have seen these black ear pods floating around or some variant of them or if you just google ear pods clone there's a whole world of tws I 500s being sold or drop ships from various online retailers and there are even companies out there right now you might have already seen the singer feed that are using stolen footage from my ear pods Pro review and using them in Instagram ads to try to convince you to buy their fake drop shipped air pod clones it's everywhere so the bottom line is everyone pretty much everyone capable of making headphones in some way is now making small pocketable,297.84,621.843,192.98899999999998
Marques Brownlee,zHAB4qDsgKY,Earphone,Apple,completely wireless earbuds that seal up in a case and connect to your phone so this has some pros and cons of course we all know the downsides which are if you want to listen to music through wired headphones you to carry a dongle everywhere and often the quality is substantially worse over Bluetooth audio than wired but also wireless audio is just not great yet it's getting there but if you've ever tried to edit a video or music with wireless headphones you know how bad the latency and the lag can get and you know we're talking about it's just not quite there yet but because of all that the upside is the same thing that created the downside which is that now everyone is trying to make the best possible wireless audio solution the best possible wireless headphones to try to beat air pots and we see this in the forms of all different types of features the reverse wireless charging on phones the Razer hammerheads focusing on and minimizing latency Sony's WF 1000 XM 3 doing active noise cancellation better than any other earbud I've ever heard and they pretty much all feature an assistant now - there's Syrian air pods which means there's Google assistant in pixel buds and many others Bixby and galaxy buds and Cortana in surface buds in theory anyway when those come out it means everyone's working towards a better world of wireless so that maybe this wireless future we've dreamed of isn't so far off after all now I have no excuse for they're like shameless blatant earpods ripoffs like these are just clearly trying to make a buck shamelessly trying to take advantage of people looking for a deal but the truth really is air pods are Apple's most impactful and successful product since the original iPhone and who wouldn't want to copy that thanks for watching catch you guys the next one pace,393.99,621.843,204.101
Marques Brownlee,cG8PXdTlDag,Earphone,Apple,oh [Music] hey what's up guys mkbhd here airpods pro i guess a lot of people care about these airpods became the most popular headphones on planet earth pretty quickly within about two or three years of them coming out and so smartly apples decided to follow up with and capitalize on that with a professional version of them aka one with noise cancellation and a couple extra new features they're pretty good so we all know they're 250 and they're not actually replacing airpods too as much as they're living on the site alongside them and so they're not just the new airpods but they're also the best of airpods so in that impressions video i went over each of the new features of airpods pro and what it does and so now that i've been using them for about a week it's time to go over how good each of those things actually is so let's start with the new design the ever so memeable new design i think they're fine i'm not really in love with any earbud design at the moment so really any improvement from airpods 2 is good to see so the stems here are shorter which is good it technically brings the microphone further from your mouth but they sound just as good for phone calls then at the bottom of the stem you have a force sensor instead of touch sensor now so you're squeezing to play pause double squeezing to move to the next track long squeeze to turn on noise cancellation it was annoying at first because the shorter stem is a bit closer to the side of your head the way they fit but then i got used to just squeezing the sides normally the only bummer is there's no volume control from the buds at all i honestly think that might be my least favorite thing about the design i really don't want to have to ask siri to change the volume every time hands-free maybe that's just me anyway they fit into this landscape magnetic case that,0.56,621.843,226.928
Marques Brownlee,cG8PXdTlDag,Earphone,Apple,honestly is still pretty small it's bigger than the old airpods case but it still easily fits in a pocket and a lot of other wireless earbuds cases have come through the studio lately and they're consistently typically much bigger than the airpods case to the point where some of them aren't even really pocketable i can still fit the airpods pro case in the tiny pocket i never use inside the pocket in my jeans so yeah not a problem here but of course the most important difference with airpods pro is the silicon ear tips instead of the hard plastic going into your ears turns out to be a major win for a lot of people like me who literally can't wear regular airpods for more than about three minutes before they're just sliding out these actually stay in my ears i can walk around move more than normal work out and they create a nice little seal and that's already a big functional difference but the important thing for earbuds people is that the seal isn't uncomfortable so typically when you put earbuds like this into your ears you're also pushing air into your ear too which can be uncomfortable because it creates a bit of pressure there but with air pods pro the pass-through cutout that lets air through equalizes pressure and by the time you're wearing them it honestly makes it easy to forget you're wearing earbuds even for someone like me who doesn't wear earbuds very often which is impressive so you get them in your ear they're comfortable they've solved the first major problem which is staying in your ear the next question is how do they sound so i have two answers when the noise cancellation is off they sound just like regular airpods they're fine when noise cancellation is on they do sound dramatically better airpods pro get really loud to the point where i never need them at full volume and most if not all the improvements in the actual sound are as a direct result of you having a decent seal now instead,122.399,621.843,218.082
Marques Brownlee,cG8PXdTlDag,Earphone,Apple,of no seal at all before i'll refer you to quinn from snazzy labs for an audiophile's perspective on exactly how airpods sound in which he describes them as mid heavy and i completely agree but i'll let you check out his excellent video i'll link it below so that being said let's talk about that noise cancellation this is its biggest strength so there's three modes noise canceling off and transparency mode and the noise cancellation is really impressive to me with earbuds they do well in noisy environments but they're at their best with you know more consistent white noise so something like the din of a coffee shop or being in a car on a road trip or even on an airplane [Music] you know i was just thinking about it recently this because of the feature set being so unique this is i think my only pair of noise canceling open back earbuds just very strange but i do love that they do noise cancellation now you can't control the level of noise cancellation but it makes everything sound better and people who previously have only used you know airpods or other headphones that don't do this will love these then there is transparency mode which i almost was equally impressed by so it uses the microphones built in to pass through audio around you and it's this really natural sounding pass-through with maybe a little bit of hiss or exaggeration at the high end but in general it sounds like you're just not wearing anything in your ears at all which makes it easy to forget that you're wearing them so this is a good mode if you're you know walking or running next to a road or you're on a plane waiting to hear the announcements or just generally don't want to be totally isolated from your environment [Music] oh and then there's the regular just on,231.44,621.843,217.89799999999997
Marques Brownlee,cG8PXdTlDag,Earphone,Apple,mode in the middle which doesn't really do anything crazy with noise cancellation or transparency it just turns the earbuds on and saves a bit of battery this one just sounds like you're wearing air pods with silicone tips not amazing sound but you do have a little bit better of a seal than you typically would for battery overall for airpods pro apple says four and a half hours with noise cancelling or transparency on five hours with noise cancelling off i kept it on all the time i got about four hours that's not a full flight sometimes which is interesting but the quick charge in the case is at least convenient so if you do get low you can plug in for a couple minutes and get an hour of charge out of that and they charge via lightning so a couple other faqs number one do they work with android yes now they will again not be the best for android they lose some of the convenience features the auto play pause the siri of course integration but they do work as bluetooth earbuds can you use third-party custom silicon tips or replace them with foam tips that you might like better no as far as i know this connection between the earbud is actually proprietary so definitely try not to lose them because you're stuck with what comes in the box or you can go for the four dollar replacement tips straight from apple surprisingly reasonably priced are they good for workouts sure i've done it they are sweatproof technically they're ipx4 water resistant which means you can sweat on them and they survived for me but if i was looking specifically for workout headphones i would look more towards something like the powerbeats pro which will specifically stay in my ear better and get beat up more and be fine but if you want just one pair of earbuds to be fine for everything yes these will survive a workout better than the previous airpods so then are airpods pro the best wireless earbuds yes,346.88,621.843,221.52
Marques Brownlee,cG8PXdTlDag,Earphone,Apple,but no but yes but no like there are headphones that sound better the sony wf-1000 xm3s for example uh terrible name uh these do sound better than the airpods they also have better noise cancellation than airpods pro they also have a longer battery life than airpods pro they also have better customization in their app than airpods pro like these are technically better headphones for sure but the airpods pro nail so many things about everyday use like the case size for one that's a pretty dramatic difference and also as dumb as these might look there are some other designs that are way dumber and you do get used to the stock thing and it just ends up being natural and of course the fast charging is convenient and the h1 chip so that it pairs instantly with any iphone you want and then the rest of the apple ecosystem and it blending in with ios 13 so well all this stuff more than makes up for it they're not audiophile grade headphones they're not great dedicated workout headphones they're not the perfect headphones for flying but if i could only pick one pair of earbuds to do all this stuff with i would pick airpods pro and a lot of people are going to make that choice they're imperfectly perfect imp is is that a word that's probably not a word but you know what that's still going to be the title so that's been it that's my airpods pro review they're really good and just for fun since y'all made it this far if you head over to twitter i'm going to be giving away a second pair of airpods so you can check these out i'm going to give away this pair of dbranded airpods pro of course the headphones and the case only come in white so you might as well get some color going and customize the case so you know exactly which one is yours when they start showing up everywhere details will be below but yeah sometime in the next 24 hours look for that tweet that's been it thank you for watching catch you guys in the next one peace you,457.919,621.843,231.242
Marques Brownlee,MrUhzYdcX6w,Earphone,Apple,[Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and these are the new airpods pro could you tell the difference yeah right good because i i wouldn't want you thinking i had like the old airpods or something all right so apple's quietly dropped the new airpods on their site yesterday and i've been using them for about a day now from when this video is going live so these are some first impressions and they're honestly pretty nice now these cost 250 dollars like that's pretty high-end so at this point they can't sound like crap anymore they're actually competing with some other really nice headphones at this price or even nice earbuds at this price so what's so pro about these new airpods pro well i'll tell you everything that's new first of all the new design so you can see them here they're a little bit smaller and they have a shorter stem and they kind of look like that one pokemon or maybe a hair dryer or maybe even pingu man the internet is fast to meme these new apple products but i honestly don't think they look that bad they're a little less toothbrushy more reasonable looking more compact we've seen how weird these types of headphones can get with stuff like the microsoft surface buds i think this is an improvement i actually wish they came in more colors and that actually was one of the rumors that there might be a black pair and as hard as they would be to find if,0.42,621.843,185.01900000000003
Marques Brownlee,MrUhzYdcX6w,Earphone,Apple,you lost them i still would have liked to have seen that but you still have glossy white now again for your in-ear headphones but they are now officially ipx4 rated for water resistance so that's good for you know it's sweat resistant basically good for a light rain if you're wearing them you want to go outside you shouldn't have to worry ipx4 and there's of course the rubber tips now so in the unboxing you'll see they come with three different size rubber tips total the mediums are attached out the box and they have a smaller pair and a bigger pair and actually do a little apple magic with that that i'll show you in a second and they of course still have the h1 chip so they'll pair by just being near your iphone and opening the case and then you get this little tutorial on how to use these new airpods pro and with this tutorial as you can see it talks you through media controls reading you your messages out loud with siri and ios 13.2 and noise cancellation and that's because that's right airpods pro do have active noise cancellation and this is a rumor that i was sort of on the fence about if they would do it or not they did it so this isn't just the passive noise isolation that comes with any pair of earbuds that make a seal in your ear this uses the microphones and the earbuds themselves to do active additional noise cancellation in earbuds and this is just my first impression so far but the noise cancellation is pretty decent,107.2,621.843,159.521
Marques Brownlee,MrUhzYdcX6w,Earphone,Apple,i'd say it's about on par if you get a good seal with the beats solo pro that i've been testing which are on ear headphones i mean they're honestly better than i expected from any sort of earbuds i don't use many noise canceling earbuds not sure if i'd wear them on a plane they're not that good but hey maybe some testing will change my mind in time for when i do the full review the earbuds themselves as you've seen have this larger black grille on the sides and that's for air to pass through so even when you're wearing them with the in-ear seal you can still hear sounds and you don't feel like you're all clogged up when you normally wear earbuds because of that air pass-through so that's pretty cool and you can still hear sounds around you and that's thanks to transparency mode so you can turn on the noise cancellation a bunch of different ways you can flip it on in the quick settings in ios 13.2 with that volume or you can squeeze the stem which is now pressure sensitive for about a second and it'll activate noise cancellation or you can even activate it from your watch if you want to either way you'll hear a chime and it kicks in and it's this pretty good noise cancellation without that vacuum feeling thanks to the air pass-through there's even built into ios this little thing this is the magic i talked about called the ear tip fit test and you can open it and run through it it'll play a short sound into your ear and use the microphones inside airpods pro to,186.4,621.843,161.68
Marques Brownlee,MrUhzYdcX6w,Earphone,Apple,determine if you have a good fit or not a good seal if you don't it'll tell you either one or both of them you need to adjust the size of the rubber tips you have on for a better seal and then you can get them right i haven't seen that anywhere before and it seems to work really well and again this isn't the full review but as far as sound quality they sound fine you know these are new drivers and with the noise cancellation on they sound better and without the noise cancellation they sound okay you know i'm gonna give much more detailed feedback for the full review and i'll compare them to other earbuds and things in the price range but for now not bad oh and of course you can't forget last but not least the new case uh the case itself is actually a little bigger a little bit wider mostly than the previous airpods case but nothing too drastic it's almost like you turn the old one sideways and stretch that a little bit but it still has wireless charging like gen 2 still very pocketable and still gives you that quick charging and 24 hours of total battery life and it's also still lightning not that i expected usb type c for every apple pro product but yeah still lightning but that is pretty much everything that's new with the brand new airpods pro why are they called the pro i don't know it's just kind of like everything that's high end is just called pro now whether it's usbc or high refresh rate or multiple colors or not um i know for a fact there's no audio,267.44,621.843,166.56
Marques Brownlee,MrUhzYdcX6w,Earphone,Apple,engineers waiting to use airpods pro in their studios but those are the new features and so far it seems like a pretty complete package but i think in theory this solves what my biggest problem was with the previous airpods which is they didn't sound great but they also fell out of my ear instantly this is about how much you'd stick in a normal pair of air pods right so that's like five yards of running so in theory these new ones solve that problem for me by having this little rubber tip they're not going to fall out of my ear as easily and they're going to sound better and that's definitely good to see but let me know are you into these are you into this i mean this weird silent announcement they did with airpods pro they're on the site now they're available today or tomorrow i believe you can get them in stores october 30th and they look a little different but same vibe same idea just more expensive and some more features the cancellation is actually pretty impressive definitely stay tuned for the full review for sound quality and all of my thoughts and let me know if you have any questions or comments down below what you want to see in the full review and subscribe to be among the first to see it if you haven't already either way until the next one thank you for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music],350.72,621.843,142.63899999999995
Marques Brownlee,JdTBIHX-r0M,Earphone,Apple,[Music] [Music] hey what's up guys mkbhd here and these are the powerbeats pro that's right i'm reviewing beats so you may have seen or heard about these in various ads like the one you just watched and i do gotta say even though everyone in that actual commercial was technically a professional athlete i still think the word pro is overused in products like why are these the powerbeats pro but that's a rant for another day at the end of the day these are just headphones so when i started using these i just wanted to know how good of headphones are they and are they worth the money because they are 250 so they better be good then again they are beats now it turns out spoiler they are pretty great i still think they're overpriced but as wireless earbuds they're pretty great so you can think of these as air pods but if apple actually cared about them staying in people's ears so easily my favorite part about these powerbeats pro is how they're built like i've never been a huge earbuds kind of guy but for working out and for moving around and things like that you have to have something lightweight so that's when i prefer earbuds and they just gotta stay in my ears and be comfortable air pods never really fit in my ears i wasn't as lucky as a lot of you guys but there are two main differences with these versus air pods that actually keep them in my ear,0.0,621.843,162.17799999999997
Marques Brownlee,JdTBIHX-r0M,Earphone,Apple,so number one similar to jaybirds i've had in the past these have a soft touch replaceable ear tip that you can put different sizes on so instead of having just hard plastic one size fits all these are soft touch and they fit pretty well and then number two this piece that goes basically over and around your ear and then holds it snugly to hold the earbuds in and these i mean you can either get the kind that go into the ear up here or over and around i actually really like these the first pair of earbuds i ever really used a lot in high school also had these and they're they're not coming off so just generally i like the design i got the black ones so they're all matte black plastic sweatproof of course and the clamp force while it is snug it isn't too tight uh and the sign of any good pair of headphones is that you can wear them for a long time and after a while you just kind of forget you're wearing them that's good okay they also differ from airpods in a couple of not so great ways the first one being this case it maybe looks like a small case which is me holding it in my hand but this is a huge case i mean i guess i do love that they include a matte black protective hard shell case with them with built-in battery and charging there's a little light on the outside of the case and there's a pair button on the inside that's all great but this actually makes me really appreciate the air pods and their super small wireless charging case of course airpods,104.159,621.843,160.24099999999999
Marques Brownlee,JdTBIHX-r0M,Earphone,Apple,are smaller but the airpods case is actually pocketable easily the beats case just is not so that's kind of a big deal sometimes if you're you know walking around and you just don't have a bag if you have a gym bag you can toss it in there but if you don't this is not great in the pocket and then the case only charges via lightning so no usb type c and no wireless charging so even with all this space and even putting them actually in the case was this motion that for some reason i never quite got used to obviously airpods you just drop it in there and there's magnets and it's super easy these have magnets too and you can see the pins but it's not quite as smooth you have to get the angle just right i don't know maybe that's just me but then the best difference with these versus air pods is the actual bud so number one they actually do sound better yeah you know they're a little bit bass heavy but i mean come on what'd you expect they're beats i'm not looking for a flat sound signature here they're fun good sounding headphones the seal that you can create with the rubber tip in your ear plus the clamp force on the side and them not coming out they're a rich good sounding pair of headphones but then number two the actual physical buttons on them there's no touch points there's real buttons so on the right ear the beats logo is a button and that can be your play pause of course double tap for the next song triple tap for the previous and on top of each earbud is a volume rocker so this is better than voice control better,184.159,621.843,162.00099999999998
Marques Brownlee,JdTBIHX-r0M,Earphone,Apple,than the swiping across panels of the sides of headphones it's just simple and easy regular volume rocker not over engineered love it of course if you still want to use voice control you can they have the h1 chip so you can do a little hey siri action if you have an iphone and they'll still respond to that sorry for triggering anyone's homepod if anyone still has homepods out there but anyway that brings us to the couple of ways that these are similar to airpods by the way i'm comparing these to airpods because well apple bought beats so beats are apple headphones now but also because they're just the most popular headphones everyone has so there's that so the powerbeats pro have the h1 chip in them which means they do that sweet instant pairing with an iphone or just regular bluetooth pairing with any android phone just like airpods and there's also auto play pause when you take them out your ears and put them back in they'll also do the siri voice command if you're into that or if you're on an android phone you can long press the beats logo to trigger google assistant or whatever assistant you use and then the battery life is just as good so thankfully eight plus hours of playback easily it has automatic standby if you put them down when they're not in the case they can go for me like a week without charging if i start with a full battery and a full case and on top of that there is fast charging so if they're dead you can drop them in the case for like five minutes and it gets you over an hour of listen time so that's pretty clutch so airpods,265.44,621.843,167.12000000000003
Marques Brownlee,JdTBIHX-r0M,Earphone,Apple,2 are already pretty expensive at 160 bucks but like i said these are 250 dollars for a pair of powerbeats pro so while they are better than airpods yes especially for someone like me i still don't know if i can say they're worth 250 dollars i guess if you absolutely must have the completely wireless you know no wire between the buds then you know i guess that makes sense these are some of the best ones especially if you're an athlete if you need them to be sweatproof you need them to stay in your ears while you move around a lot you need workout headphones i wouldn't blame you if you got these you'll probably be very happy with them but just because these are so expensive i feel like you can easily recommend something i've used in the past the jaybird x4s they do have a wire between them but they're super lightweight great battery life sweat proof they stay in my ears just fine and they're somewhere around like 100 110 bucks so i'll leave links to the alternative stuff that i'm talking about right below the like button as well as links to the beats but i think the price is the only thing holding these back overall the stamp of apple is very evident on the powerbeats pro from the h1 chip to their very high price tag but overall there's not much negative there's not much bad to say about these so i'll give them credit for that they actually made a good pair of headphones um and they live up to the ads so that's that's good too no regrets i think i just recommended a pair of beats on video thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,348.56,621.843,174.56

Marques Brownlee,PEFUuP3eWCc,Earphone,Competitor,[Music] so the pixel buds a series the cheapest ones right now cost 69 nice but the old retired 2020 pixel buds before they stopped being sold were 179 dollars and i really like them i reviewed them i thought they were nice but they did lack active noise cancellation and so they sort of fell a tiny step behind the most premium best wireless earbuds that were out and so i mentioned this at the end of my review this is exactly what i said maybe later they'll do a some next-gen or a more premium pixel buds pro and they'll be 279 and they'll do a noise cancellation and a bigger battery and it turns out well that's exactly what we have here this is pixel buds pro active noise cancellation larger battery except they're only 1.99 and actually if you're cool with any color other than coral they're literally already on sale on amazon for less than the price of the last pixel buds so just to get out of the way right off the top these have nailed it from every single turn from the case to the fit to the sound to the features you probably just close this video right now and just pick up these but don't do that because then you'd ruin the watch time on this video and then that's no fun so how about how about i take you along and i'll show you why these are so good so first of all the case that these come in is basically the same as before which is to say underrated like so many wireless headphones have annoyingly thick or larger cases this is a nice compact clean well-made case sure the white might get a little dirty after a while but it's got this super satisfying magnet to open and close it is ipx2 splash resistant as a case and it has a usbc port at the bottom but also has wireless charging so you can pop it on any qi wireless charger you already have or on the back your phone if it supports power sharing and that's all in a package that fits in the coin pocket in my jeans an all-around absolute win in the case but it's what's inside the case that we're here for and the pixel buds pro have this new shape to them they're mostly a matte black plastic and they have a sort of colored cap at the end that's either fog colored which is what,1.04,621.843,253.27899999999997
Marques Brownlee,PEFUuP3eWCc,Earphone,Competitor,i have it's kind of a light blue or coral a yellowish green or black so just like any other wireless earbuds you pop them out of the case you give them a quarter twist to lock them into your ears and while they don't stick out of my ears too bad like maybe the sony wf-1000xm4s it isn't the lowest profile i've ever seen either it's somewhere in between just a little bit bigger than the last pixel buds but the main difference for me is these don't have the wing tips anymore the wing tips have their upside in the downside the upside is they would absolutely stay locked in my ear much better i could run around and jump and they wouldn't fall out but the tip of it when it was in my ear for more than about an hour or two would create this pressure point that would get more uncomfortable over time and i didn't really like that too much so these don't have that anymore which means they're not quite as locked in my ear but they are more comfortable of course earbuds are different for everybody and when i switch to the larger earbud tips like they really do still stay in my ear fine for walking around normal everyday activities and things like that but yeah that's worth noting honestly i think this is the right move also the buds themselves are ipx4 rated so if you still want to work out in them they're sweat proof but i just probably won't so once it's paired up and these are in your ears there are a lot of different features in here thanks to the pixel buds app but i'm just going to start with the sound you just listen to music how do they sound and i think these sound really really good now i'll spare you the bunch of descriptors and audio file terms that i could use just to tell you basically i really like the sound from these new 11 millimeter drivers once you get a nice seal in your ear you can tell they're really crisp and clear they aren't too shrill or tinny they don't distort very much and the noise cancellation does a great job of getting rid of white noise and there's basically no perceivable bluetooth lag at all when watching videos or gaming there's just two slightly odd things that i noticed one these just have a much stronger bass than the last pixel buds i kind of noted that as a weakness in the previous pixel,127.68,621.843,228.0
Marques Brownlee,PEFUuP3eWCc,Earphone,Competitor,buds review like they were a little bit weak on the bass not these the bass on these is so much stronger and punchier and just a more full low end that it's a real character highlight like so hip hop music anything with a lot of that lower end frequency sounds really good but in like podcasts or other genres or just things where i don't need all that bass i was looking for an eq to even that out but the pixel buds app doesn't have eq and the pixel phone also doesn't have an eq i actually got a buds firmware update while i was testing these and i thought it was about to add an eq in the sound settings but all it added was this volume eq setting which basically just makes things a little punchier at lower volumes so if you do specifically want to adjust the sound signature of these maybe your phone has eq settings built in some of them do maybe the app you're using for audio has eq settings built in some of them do but yeah pixel buds themselves don't have eq built in yet and neither does a pixel phone but google has thankfully said that there is a full five band eq coming later this year hopefully soon but then the second thing i noticed is these also have a slightly lower overall volume than any other buds i've tested in a while it's not problematically low but i did find myself almost always listening either right below max volume or like two to three notches below the max volume because that was the comfortable listening level usually max volume is way too loud for more than a few seconds of listening on most earbuds but not here it feels like it feels like the bottom 40 of the volume slider is basically useless i can barely hear anything that's that low but yeah i am definitely impressed by how little distortion there is and how clear and thumpy and great it sounds at or near max volume so that's worth noting every pair of noise-cancelling earbuds shall have a transparency mode at least seems like they all should it's like an unwritten rule of these things yeah these are transparency mode built into the pixel buds pro and it's okay it's gonna let in sound from the microphones and pump in your ambient noise so you can hear what's around you but it's not the best i guess airpods are still in a league of their own when,241.84,621.843,245.12000000000003
Marques Brownlee,PEFUuP3eWCc,Earphone,Competitor,it comes to this but i'd rate these transparency mode like a b minus basically it's better than leaving them off but it certainly still sounds muffled and i'm hoping i'm hoping stuff like this gets better in the future i hope they can push firmware updates to also improve transparency mode but the pixel buds real advantage to me is still definitely the software and all the features that are built in i still love having google assistant like a hold away or a tap away anytime i want to ask a question i literally just hold it down and say how tall is the taj mahal it's like a superpower i can just just start opening light shades and turning on smart lamps and things and just yeah assistant everywhere is great and in the pixel buds app in the settings you can customize what a tap and hold on each side does so right now i have the right side hold to trigger the assistant but the left side hole toggles between noise cancellation and transparency mode pretty much every pair of earbuds nowadays also has some sort of touch controls on the outside for your media these are no different it's touch wants to play touch two times to skip forward three times to go back the one thing i couldn't quite get to work as smoothly as i'd like is swiping to change volume these they're just not a big enough surface for me to like reliably get a good swipe in i kept trying to do it but this was like the most inconsistent thing for me basically i just end up like wobbling it around in my ear it works sometimes but again it's not a big surface so what i ended up doing is i just end up reaching in my pocket and blindly like changing the volume on the volume rocker on the phone in my pocket which turned out to actually be totally fine as long as my phone was on me so and there's a bunch of other features too multi-device support so these buds are paired to both my phone and my laptop at the same time and seamlessly switch back and forth as advertised no problem i love that and then they have a find my device feature in case they get lost they have in-ear detection to automatically play and pause when you take them out and put them back in and they even have this ear tip seal check feature which analyzes how well the microphones are actually,364.16,621.843,224.24099999999993
Marques Brownlee,PEFUuP3eWCc,Earphone,Competitor,canceling out sound for you and if it's not working so well it can recommend a different size ear tip to improve the seal it's smart the only thing missing might be the like adaptive sound feature which listens to your environment and then automatically bumps up the volume when your environment gets louder i didn't really use that very much but i noticed it wasn't here so that isn't in the pixel buds pro but it's also apparently coming other than that it's not really missing anything like these have every feature that i'm used to having with earbuds and the cherry on top as they did also with this slightly larger body improve battery life so you're going to get seven hours of actual listening with active noise cancellation on which is far longer than i would ever listen to earbuds that's up to you if you want to do that 11 hours with anc off that's a huge advantage so for 199 should you just get these probably yeah i mean this is easy to recommend there are some other options out there so for around this price you're looking at you could definitely get air pods if you're into that but you can also look towards if you specifically want better sound there are better sounding earbuds but also something like samsung's new buds 2 or pro they're 229. i haven't gotten the chance to hear them yet because they just came out and samsung didn't send me any but i imagine considering how good the previous ones were that those might also be really good and then also as far as like working out in headphones or fit in the ear i still prefer a wing tip in the ear for like actual workout stuff so like beats fit pro beats studio buds those types of things stay in my ear better so worth considering that stuff but as far as like everyday buds you put them in your ear every day you take meetings on them phone calls you walk around with them you just have them on all the time google assistants your super power yeah these are great uh these are the these are the ones i'm gonna put in my backpack and keep around with me everywhere i go well done google thanks for making these please push that eq feature i'm gonna be waiting for it thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace [Music],476.56,621.843,232.25899999999996
Marques Brownlee,6CsJZxfZsL0,Earphone,Competitor,[Music] hey what's up i'm kbhd here okay so for the past few years sony's flagship noise canceling headphones have been the king of the hill of course they've made some minor adjustments and feature additions over the past few so by the time they got to the mark iii with their comfort and noise cancelling and usb type c they were the top of the market and then the mark iv added multi-device support but they've essentially looked the same sounded excellent and they've been an easy recommendation as a result but these new mark 5 on the other hand are a real departure from that formula a lot of the changes i do really like but there is one big one that i definitely don't so the first thing you might be wondering is is there actually a sound improvement but i actually wanted to start with the new design because you can see that they have this new shape that is this pretty minimal sharp and clean look there is still a dark and a light this light is a sort of a cream colored version and there's a lot of good things about this design the ear cups are slightly bigger and wider the new vegan leather material is so much softer it is it's kind of amazing it combines that with the super light weight of the whole headphones to make this entire pair more comfortable to wear for long periods of time honestly i'm just going to say this is the most comfortable pair of noise cancelling headphones i've ever tried you still have a touch sensitive panel on the right side ear cup for skipping pausing etc they actually still have on off head detection despite not having a plastic cutout in the ear cup like the last one and there's now twice as many slots for microphones around the outside it goes from four total to four on each side eight total microphones and i'll get into what that does for noise cancellation and voice quality in a second but you can see they're fairly minimal and hidden well in this new design but overall overall i actually still feel like this design is a downgrade for one main reason so what do you get noise canceling headphones for right travel you're getting them to travel and,0.24,621.843,237.27899999999997
Marques Brownlee,6CsJZxfZsL0,Earphone,Competitor,so these old versions were the king of the hill because they were obviously super comfortable had great noise cancellation and lots of features and good sound quality but they also fold it up like this and fit into uh their little case just like that toss that in a bag and you're good to go this new version with this new design does not fold at all so with this new sliding headband design which is kind of like the bose 700s and the airpods max and so many others that's the only way of adjusting the size of the headphones so they no longer fold down into a smaller size and so as a result the case you carry them around in is quite a bit bigger it's kind of a cool case it looks like a modern backpack without the straps it's got some angular origami type seams and folds along the sides and once you get inside there's a magnetic door over a compartment that holds your charging cable and an audio cable if you need one is a great case it's basically exactly like the bose 700s but yeah now it's just huge with bose though we saw them do this new design with the 700s but they at least kept around the quiet comfort series so the qc45s still fold down like they always did and the airpods max are notoriously annoying to travel with even though i still try to make it work but these are wh-1000 mark 5 which on paper makes it the sequel to the mark iv so that's a little bit dangerous but i do know that they're keeping around the mark fours these new mark fives are going to retail for 400 and they're going to keep around the mark fours for 350 although you can already find them for like 329 or 300 so these are starting to look kind of like a deal but let's just get past that design flaw they're still premium lightweight comfortable noise-canceling headphones and they have yet again bumped up the noise cancellation capabilities pretty significantly so i've been saying for years they're the king of the hill for travel because as far as white noise is concerned like airplane engines road noise all that sort of stuff they do an a plus job at canceling that right when i put these on,118.96,621.843,256.16099999999994
Marques Brownlee,6CsJZxfZsL0,Earphone,Competitor,i immediately noticed it's even stronger it still crushes that droning low end but now some of the more higher frequencies are better canceled out too appliances whinier stuff human voices too so yeah the last sony's did have world-class noise cancellation but these get even better and we can thank the extra microphones and processor for that now with any noise cancelling headphones and all those mics you also have a transparency mode these have it again and they have 20 levels of adjustment in the app of how much transparency gets through they're really good they are definitely better than the bose but the airpods max are still on a completely different level as far as transparency mode those are the best i've ever heard in any headphones it sounds like you're not wearing headphones you just hear everyone's voices and everything perfectly clearly and these just don't get that good like these just sound like a somewhat muffled version of reality uh especially with voices and the higher frequency stuff even though there is actually a specific enhanced voices toggle it just doesn't quite reach the airpods level as far as hearing your own voice but then for actual musical sound quality they are very similar to last year which is to say excellent and they do have a new 30 millimeter carbon fiber driver and there is still l back support if you have the right combination of smartphone and music source but i think i can safely say if i have an android phone these to me are among the absolute best sounding noise cancelling wireless headphones available again they don't sound as good they're not as full and crisp and balanced as airpods max paired with an iphone but obviously that's just for iphone users that have 550 dollars to burn but yeah there's just something about really good noise-canceling headphones that feels like magic like i can be in a crowded area where my eyes tell me this is a loud area but to hear absolute silence behind a perfectly isolated bass line and hear every detail of a vocal of some song like i'm in a live recording session is so sick that's what makes,246.72,621.843,244.08
Marques Brownlee,6CsJZxfZsL0,Earphone,Competitor,these headphones so good there were some rumors about the battery life getting bumped from 30 to 40 hours which would have been crazy but that's not what happened they are rated for the same 30 hours of battery life as the mark fours and from my experience so far they've right about matched it uh so 40 like would have been nice and amazing but i still think 30 and the use i've gotten out of these is still very good the one improvement though uh is the charging faster charging so you can plug these in for three minutes and get three hours of listening out of it so if you just need to plug in real quick before you go head off to some trip somewhere that's very convenient again it's a travel feature but that's what that's what i want to break this all back down to at the end of the day these are travel headphones and they no longer fold which means they are everything about them is bigger and and more difficult to travel with than the last ones oh and also this this might be minor but i do have to mention it so if you're wearing a mark fours like this and you didn't want to like do the hold to speak or listen to people and you just want to take them off real quick you can do that and then fold them down so they're just facing down and you can do other stuff and they'll just sit here the mark fives if you wear them correctly which is right side left side they don't fold down flat they actually only fold up and that's i'm definitely nitpicking like that's a small thing but for 400 that's another thing that's not in the new headphones that was nicer about the old ones so if you're actually thinking about getting these headphones this is here this is a pretty nuanced recommendation but if you are using an android phone and your bag is big enough and you plan on using these for travel listening to music phone calls if you're working with these all that sort of thing these are going to be amazing you get the sony app you've got all the customization in the world you want to do ldac listening even they sound like very good headphones and,369.12,621.843,223.839
Marques Brownlee,6CsJZxfZsL0,Earphone,Competitor,they work really well so comfortable love these headphones but if you're really anyone else i'm gonna bring back the mark fours again for this i really think you should consider the mark fours of course right because number one they're gonna cost much less they number two actually fold down so if you want them to take up less space in your bag but they're also like 90 of these headphones they sound just about as good um they might not be as trendy or premium looking as the new design but like you're gonna get the same comfort the same battery life really the only thing you're missing out on is the slightly faster charging and what those extra mics and processor get you for noise cancellation oh wait there's extra mics so maybe voice quality too all right so this is an audio test of the sony wh-1000xm4s still a bad name uh sony uh water bottles available at mkbhd.com just so you know also there's some voices in the background there's some various noises but this is it it's okay it's okay for a mic so now this is the audio quality for the wh 1000 x m5 i think it sounds better it definitely isolates the voice a little bit better against the same level of background noise but again the bar was pretty low for wireless headphones this is just generally good for calls for work for stuff where you need a mic built into the headphones alright so my theory is sony saw what bose did with the 700 headphones with this new sliding design the magnet in the case and they said all right we can do that too and we'll do our own version of it and so they did an even bigger version of the same thing sliding design magnet in the case and everything and i'm slightly annoyed by the much bigger footprint here but i mean let's be real these are really good really comfortable premium noise canceling headphones for 400 bucks with a terrible name as we'd expect from sony but that's about what we'd expect it's good all right that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace,480.8,621.843,252.31900000000002
Marques Brownlee,bInJjmH31Hk,Earphone,Competitor,[Music] what's up mkbhd here sony wh-1000xm4 these are those and you couldn't tell just by looking at them because they look almost identical to the mark iii's from the last generation but that's totally fine because no one really had any major complaints with the mark iii's at least i didn't i crowned them my active noise cancellation kings but now here they are these are the mark fours they are the same price 349 and sony smartly took the if it ain't broke don't fix it approach and basically just addressed all the small little requests that people like me had with the last generation it's like they lined up all their little nitpicks and knocked them all down so okay what was left to improve well number one my biggest request was multiple device support and it took them two years but they finally did it and they've added multiple device support to the mark iv so the ability to pair these headphones actively to more than one device at once it might sound like kind of a niche thing but it's such a big deal if you have your headphones paired to your computer and your phone at the same time or your tablet and your phone at the same time you're listening to music on one thing you get a phone call on the other and it just seamlessly automatically switches then you hang up and go back to music and it switches back it's just so much better of an experience than going into bluetooth settings unpairing then repairing manually every time so that's number one and it's actually been improving over time when i first got these headphones it didn't really work very well at all,0.54,621.843,180.578
Marques Brownlee,bInJjmH31Hk,Earphone,Competitor,but they've been getting software updates and through the sony app they've gotten better so it's fixed itself up over time and we'll probably continue to get updates and hopefully keep getting better in the future so with that by itself to be honest they probably could have stopped there and i would have been happy that's all i really wanted but number two they also made the noise cancellation better than on the mark iii's now i crown the mark iii as my active noise cancellation kings because the noise cancellation and sound quality was so good on them that i picked them over better looking better feeling cooler headphones like the surface headphones because of it and this is better so the mark iv is again sound incredible super clean and bright and full with all the same noise cancellation controls in the sony app like before all your eq settings but now the noise cancellation cancels out slightly more of some higher frequencies too so it's always been amazing with low frequency homes stuff like airplanes and trains and rumbles that you've already known but now with things like dishwashers and cars and even people's voices it cancels more of those out too now i can't necessarily tell a difference immediately between the threes and the fours as far as noise cancellation it's not like a reason to buy the force but i did notice that typing on my mechanical keyboard which has brown switches the clacking was generally canceled out really well and bottom line here is you're not going to find a better pair of noise cancellation headphones just as far as pure isolation and sound quality so if there's a better,93.84,621.843,184.23999999999998
Marques Brownlee,bInJjmH31Hk,Earphone,Competitor,one out there i haven't found it yet it's like being in another dimension sometimes there's also technically some very slight physical adjustments to the dimensions too the cushions are 10 larger so that's technically an improvement and also if you look inside the left ear cup you'll see a proximity sensor and that's for the wear detection feature that i'll get to in a second but actually believe it or not this helps me find which was the left and right ear cup a little faster but the one that really matters is the new mics so the mark iv now has a better mic pattern with five microphones for better call quality and better voice recognition so i've never really thought the microphone quality of wireless headphones was that amazing to begin with like as long as they work you can hear my voice that's fine but these actually have five microphones built into them now which is an improvement and so apparently they can cancel out background noise is better you can hear my voice a little bit more isolated so as long as that's true then that's also nice if you fire up the sony app there's again some nice convenient features in here enabled by the sensors and mics on the headphones you may never use these or you may be like me and use some of them some of the time but i'll go in order of coolest to most gimmicky here so wear detection is unique to the mark fours thanks to the added sensor in the left ear cup so with that in the sony headphones app you can tell it to pause music when you take the headphones off and turn the headphones off after they've been off of your head for a while to save battery which is smart you can also now while the music is playing put your hand over the right ear cup like that and it will drop the,185.599,621.843,180.15900000000002
Marques Brownlee,bInJjmH31Hk,Earphone,Competitor,music way down turn noise cancellation off pass through and amplify voices so in theory if you want to talk to someone while keeping the headphones on you don't want to have to do the whole on off thing you can just pull one of these and you're talking to someone i think that's maybe useful sometimes on public transit or on an airplane if we ever get to do that again if you just want to talk to someone real quick but as soon as you take your hand off the music comes right back and the noise cancellation is back on and you're right where you left off so that's all right and it's fast like i think that makes a big difference to actually using the feature if i put my hand there and you have to wait a second for it to kick in that would be kind of disappointing as soon as i put my hand there boom i'm listening to people but then maybe the most gimmicky feature is the speak to chat function which basically will use the mics and i guess other sensors in the headphone to be able to tell when i start speaking and when i do start speaking it will pause my music turn off noise cancellation and amplify voices so i'm wearing the headphones listening to music i start talking it pauses the music and now i'm having a conversation through the headphones and i guess that's fine it works it was surprisingly effective at not accidentally doing it when i wasn't talking but you know if someone walks up to me and starts talking i go what and then the music pauses and then i'm talking to them,275.759,621.843,160.721
Marques Brownlee,bInJjmH31Hk,Earphone,Competitor,now the music is paused and i have to play it again or go back into the settings to turn the noise cancellation back on and you can you can tell it in the settings to turn that automatically off after 15 seconds 30 seconds or 60 seconds but generally this wasn't a feature i found myself wanting to use very much so you can turn it on but i turned it off overall though these are basically my ideal headphones you know i think the design could be cooler if it had dials on the side like the surface headphones or maybe some more cool colors like a matte red or something like that but generally this same matte black understated design is totally fine with me the same touch pad on the side that's cool the same google assistant or amazon alexa trigger from the custom button on the bottom it's fine the same case they came with is also fine i have a designated place in my backpack for them and there's just really nothing fundamentally wrong with these headphones at all and i very much appreciate that about them so it's pretty clear these are great and they're easy to recommend but a nice bonus of these existing now is that the mark threes i've seen on sale as low as about 250 bucks so i'll leave a link to those below as well they again won't have multi-point support so if you don't need two paired things at once this could be a nice discount i'll have that linked below but again the mark iv is pretty sick so thank you sony for making this such an easy review thank you to the histogram t-shirt for sponsoring this video shop.mkbhd.com and thank you for watching catch you guys the next one peace,356.08,621.843,196.559
Marques Brownlee,QZgIArBFmmE,Earphone,Competitor,hey what's up guys I'm Kim PhD here so a pretty general theory I've had going for a while now is every product category that's well established enough has a go-to like an easy to recommend checks all the boxes safe bet straight shot right down the middle like if you want a mouse there's the Logitech MX series that's been around if you want a microphone the Shure sm7b is like the standard for phones it's like the iPhone now this doesn't mean that this is the one for everyone in fact it usually isn't for everyone you use that as a sort of a starting point and then when you find the the values you have and the things you like then you Veer off into the Alternatives that you might pay more for but there's always that starting go to and so for wireless earbuds that aren't airpods the go-to is the Samsung Galaxy buds Plus for sure 100 and they should be now that doesn't mean they're perfect that doesn't mean they're for everyone but they check all of the fundamental boxes that make them incredibly easy to recommend and enjoy they're pretty great so what's so great about these 150 dollar wireless earbuds well when you look at what you want from these they got to be small check they got to be lightweight check they got to fit in your ears and that's a check for me they do fit well in my ear comfortably thanks to the rubber tips unlike air pods and they actually create a sort of a passive seal now they're not active noise canceling but you know at this price you,2.48,621.843,170.67900000000003
Marques Brownlee,QZgIArBFmmE,Earphone,Competitor,don't really see that that much but the seal is actually enough that I don't miss it that much and I realize everyone's ears are different so you know different people will have slightly different fits but I was really impressed with the fit of these earbuds and how snug they are in my ear now I'd personally still rather have an active noise cancellation version of these that's for my values and what I like like so if they made that like a pro version I'd be super cool with that but even just putting these in my ear I feel like I'm talking louder because they create that seal and dim down the environment and by the time you start playing music you don't really hear much else so for flying and mass transit and construction and Loud stuff maybe this isn't the way to go but generally for everyday use pretty good so they're comfortable then they have a legitimate Best in Class 11 hour battery life for music listening which is mostly what I do with earbuds and that's great and fast charging but honestly being able to go a full week of casual listening and not having any battery anxiety till like the last day of the week is awesome and then speaking of charging the case these sit in are also pretty textbook you can't forget about the case it's small and slim it's just as pocketable and lightweight as airpods and it has USB type c for charging and it's also capable of wireless charging if you want to put it on the back of your phone or on any,88.5,621.843,158.281
Marques Brownlee,QZgIArBFmmE,Earphone,Competitor,wireless charger it'll do that too and it even has a nice hinge weight and magnets for the lid to open and close with a satisfying click it's maybe not quite as satisfying as pixel buds but that's a pretty good click the buds are built well they have this sort of a rubber fin around the outside that helps them seat in your ear instead of like one little piece poking out that can get kind of painful and I found that this was enough to stay in my ears really well not quite as locked in as say the jaybirds with the full-on wingtips on those things but locked in enough that I felt comfortable working out in them it had no problems they stay in my ears and speaking of working out these are ipx2 rated so some sweat is fine now I still I would say they shouldn't be dedicated workout headphones like maybe Power Beats or anything ipx7 certified but if you wear them every day and you like happen to step out and sweat while wearing them or do a quick workout they are fine and then the touch controls are also really simple both earbuds have that pretty large touchpad surface and that's where you play pause that's where you fast forward accept calls long press first assistant all that stuff I've been using them with my OnePlus 8 Pro so they call Google Assistant not Bixby but they work fine with any Android phone or iPhone for that matter but they do work a little bit better with a Samsung phone because then you can get the Galaxy buds app and that gives you a little more,167.58,621.843,168.898
Marques Brownlee,QZgIArBFmmE,Earphone,Competitor,control over customizing media controls and Ambient sound pass-through but generally even without that app they've been Rock Solid no connection issues even walking across the studio leaving my phone over here having them in my backpack no problem and then the sound from these guys was really quite good I was very impressed and happy with the sound from these they have what I would call a very full sound they have a big rich full bass crisp clean mids and highs no background hisss these are tuned by AKG and they're proud to put their name on it and I can see why the only complaint I could see coming from a different pair of earbuds or headphones is these may actually feel a bit bass heavy if you're not used to all this but they can turn that down in the EQ quite easily but I'll tell you right now I won't be doing that I listen to a lot of music and the way they sound out the box is great it's already great for music I think I'd go so far as to say these are the best sounding non-noise canceling wireless earbuds I've tried this is the truth right now honestly it makes me kind of wish I brought them out on the channel sooner I don't really have anything bad to say about these but I'm gonna nitpick because that's what you do and that's how you get products to be better the next time around I'm sure Samsung was working on a next version of these so what I'll say is these don't really look that great to me I feel like they could do with a little bit better of a design I mean I guess almost none,251.879,621.843,165.422
Marques Brownlee,QZgIArBFmmE,Earphone,Competitor,really look that great but to me pixel buds do look really good and I love the colors I wish airpods did colors too like this but I don't know for some reason it looks like it feels like cheap plastic to me I think maybe a matte finish that the more premium ones got going on looks better and I think that could have saved these a bit too but look Galaxy buds Plus it's the go-to just remember the name you know they the battery life I think is their best feature and that's a nice relaxing comfortable feature to have be really good but the sound is really good the fit in my ears is really good the microphones are pretty good and then the case is great just checks all the boxes so it's like now that you know about these you might decide oh okay what I know I like I want to spend more because I want noise cancellation and then you can go get active noise cancellation you spend a bit more and there's plenty of options for those like the Sony is an airpods Pro or you might go you know what I like these but I also want them to be more workout focused headphones then you go for something with better waterproofing or more of the wingtip fit in the ear stuff like the Jay birds or Powerbeats so there's other headphones that do plenty of things better than these but if there's anyone out there wondering what's the de facto set of non-air PODS wireless earbuds there you go Samsung Galaxy buds plus now you know so there you have it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,334.68,621.843,168.4
Marques Brownlee,48bK3mmjgRE,Earphone,Competitor,hey what's up guys mkbhd here so wireless earbuds if you're going to get rid of the headphone jack you might as well make them good right but as far as like the de facto standard wireless earbuds for android you'd think google would make the best ones and when they finally got rid of the headphone jack in the pixel they did make the first pixel buds but they weren't that good they were pretty disappointing honestly they had the cable between them they had missing features they weren't very comfortable so i never really recommended them but now these these are the new 2020 pixel buds maybe you've seen them by now and they are way better they are miles better than the previous ones that wasn't a very high bar to clear but they vaulted so far up they're now in my top three favorite wireless earbuds period so i'll share that list at the end of this video but let's talk about what they did so much better and why so the big bullet points for these are they're 179 they have a five hour battery life and they don't have noise cancellation so actually on the surface with just those specs they're not that impressive at all right you know pretty average battery life and no noise cancellation like some of the other premium buds so what makes them so good and honestly it's just that they nail all the fundamentals like really well and they've just been rock solid to use so you can start off with the case here it's a sweet soft touch matte finish and i like this white one and it's got a black and white contrast like a like the panda pixel basically there's matching lights one on the inside and one on the outside and the buds just go right in and snap satisfyingly into place with the magnets pretty easily and they're strong magnets so they're easy to get out but once you snap them in they're not going anywhere and it's got this satisfying snap shut with the magnets and the hinge a lot of them have this but not all of them do the old fabric ones definitely didn't so this is sweet and it's just small it's just a little small little pebble case it's really pocketable it's around the same size same volume as an air pods pro case if you've seen that before and it's just as thin so on the spectrum of different case sizes for wireless buds these are really nice that makes a big difference for me as far as,2.96,621.843,256.72
Marques Brownlee,48bK3mmjgRE,Earphone,Competitor,how often i want to carry them around and actually use them basically if they can fit in the tiny pocket inside the main pocket in my jeans i'm in i'll carry these but then on top of all of that it's a usb type-c port on the bottom for wired charging and there's also wireless charging so you can drop them on a wireless charger where the coils line up like this nomad one or any flat one but ironically not the pixel stand by google or on the back of any phone that supports reverse wireless charging okay pause just that right there just in this new case is a lot more than many other wireless buds can say you know so many times the case is too big or it's not a high quality build like this is a nice case wireless charging usb type-c all this together that's nice so then we get to the buds these are also white if you want to go a little more low-key there is also a black version and some other colors coming soon but they're also very small to the point where the super low profile in my ear is a nice selling point they don't stick out very far at all like it basically just looks like a little disc in your ear there's no stem and they stay in my ears really well thanks to these little mini wingtip things now these are permanently attached to the buds so they're part of the actual earbud unlike some of the jaybirds i've liked in the past that are much more adjustable and you know everybody's ears are different so it's hard to say if this will work for everyone but they're a great fit for me you set them in place and you just kind of twist them into your ear and they lock into your ear and they're not going anywhere and comfort is also very good i'm using the medium sized rubber tips that came with them and they work great the longest i usually have you know headphones in in a row is maybe three or four hours tops for like a flight or something and that's that's about as long as i'd wear these although i know some people keep their headphones in like all day to work in a coffee shop and i think that's pushing it for these the wing tip at that point starts to feel like kind of a pressure point but as far as others i've tried the rock solid lock in my ear and the shape of them is great and again way better than,131.68,621.843,241.35999999999999
Marques Brownlee,48bK3mmjgRE,Earphone,Competitor,the previous pixel buds but then the other scenario for me is working out in them and i've gotten really picky about workout headphones and i tried i did i worked out in these i went running in them and they stay in my ears 100 that's true but i still prefer the jaybirds with the bigger soft wingtip those just feel more secure and comfortable in my ear but if you do want to double these as workout headphones they do stay in the ear and of course the upside is the pixel buds are also ipx4 water resistant so if you want to go work out on them they'll survive some sweat or some rain if you go running outdoors so all that is great so how do they sound that's the big question with these a lot of people have had some mixed opinions on them to keep it perfectly simple they sound pretty great i'm a fan of the sound these guys have 12 millimeter drivers that give great detail and volume even some impressive instrument separation if you're just like sitting still and just listening which i did for a while no weird issues or anything with the sound and they're compatible with a great variety of stuff now i think the downside some people will have is the bass is lacking a little bit of punch you know it's a little bit lighter on the bass now this is fine for watching videos and phone calls and podcasts but a lot of people are used to more bass when listening to music you know if you've come from like beats or something else with heavier bass so you might prefer a bit of a different sound now this is typically where i'd say okay go ahead and head into the eq and add some bass back but there is no eq built into the pixel buds app so that's definitely something to keep in mind if you know what kind of sound you really like but i think the main thing to keep in mind here as far as sound is these are not active noise-canceling headphones uh they are what's called passive noise isolating which basically just means uh the physical seal that it makes in your ear is all you get and i guess really i don't mind too much that they don't have it like it would be nice you know on one hand the noise cancellation i've heard from the 2 to 300 350 earbuds like airpods pro sony wf-1000xm3s you know those those more,252.64,621.843,246.95800000000003
Marques Brownlee,48bK3mmjgRE,Earphone,Competitor,expensive ones it's really nice and they sound better but these do undercut them quite a bit in price so i guess i can't be too mad especially when i do everything else so well okay extra features so there's a lightweight pixel buds app that you install during the setup process when you first pair these buds on your phone and you get some nice little extras down in there first of all it lays out and lets you learn all the swiping and tapping controls on the buds works on both sides for media and they're pretty easy to learn swipe forward or backward for volume one tap to play pause two taps to skip forward triple tap to go back and a long press to pull up google assistant i found this pretty intuitive the only downside is the buds are so small that you know when i was first learning these headphones i would like miss the earbud and i'd like kind of hit the back of it and almost knock it out of my ear when i'm trying to swipe uh but i've gotten used to that over time and let me tell you having the google assistant in your ear all the time pretty sweet you just say the keyword i'm not going to say it out loud but you just say that and suddenly you're asking it questions all the time and there's just something that feels like the future about putting your finger up to your ear like an fbi agent and just asking it a random question and getting an answer in your ear even if i do just keep asking it the weather over and over again i love it there's also a feature called adaptive sound which is basically supposed to change the volume of your media automatically based on the loudness of the environment you're in but i haven't been in an environment loud enough to see if this really works well so i don't know i just leave this off and i swipe to change the volume myself and the awesome case i talked about also does quick charge so if you find the battery is about to die and you have a little bit of a quick break pop them in the case for 10 minutes and you get two more hours of listening time out of it and that gives you a 24 hours total with the buds and the case battery when it comes down to it i really like these earbuds i think they're enough to to turn me into the wearing earbuds everywhere i go guy you know i've never,375.919,621.843,250.16000000000008
Marques Brownlee,48bK3mmjgRE,Earphone,Competitor,really been that person you see people walk around with airpods like 100 of the time um i guess it's something about this quarantine life of being able to walk around the house with your earbuds in but your phone's upstairs but you can still call up the assistant and listen to a podcast it's kind of nice and as a bonus there is no noticeable bluetooth lag when watching videos with the headphones or playing games or anything like that which is awesome and you constantly also know your battery life thanks to the app which may give you a bit of anxiety but i find it helpful but it really just nails the fundamentals across the board biggest downside i think is no noise cancellation but you know for people who have used passive noise isolating earbuds before we know if you turn the volume up loud enough you can't really hear anything else around you anyway i wouldn't fly with these because it doesn't have noise cancellation but that's just me also the battery life is average-ish and i think if they did do noise cancellation with these the battery life would have gotten even worse and that would have been pretty bad maybe later they'll do a some next-gen or a more premium pixel buds pro and they'll be 279 and the noise cancellation and bigger battery i could see that but until then these new 2020 pixel buds nice uh there are some of my favorite airpods right now right alongside i'll go this is top three along with airpods pro and galaxy buds plus from samsung they are above the sennheisers that i love so much even though the sennheisers sound better um because this is so much smaller and more portable and more likely for me to use it so well done google thumbs up for the pixel buds this is my review unit i'm gonna be sending it back but i will be buying a pair and i think making them my everyday headphones um but let me know what you think are you are you a headphones everywhere kind of person and if so would you get pixel buds or let me know what you think in the comment section below thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace,501.199,621.843,238.96
Marques Brownlee,DAxj9CjczXw,Earphone,Competitor,hey what is up guys mkbhd here and this is the bose quiet comfort 35 the qc35s these are the successor to i guess pretty much the gold standard for premium noise canceling headphones at this point which is the bose qc25 these are obviously you know they're red and black so they've got some color going on with them but these have been my go-to for you know train rides and flights for the past couple years so naturally when you get a successor to them you kind of have to wonder you know what's different about them and are they worth the difference in price on amazon right now the qc 25 are 300 bucks and the new qc35 are 350 bucks now in a pair of really premium noise canceling headphones you look for a couple things build quality comfort sound quality and then of course how good the noise cancellation actually is now build quality is just fine here it's nearly identical to the qc25s they're a pretty overall lightweight pair of plastic built headphones pretty flexible and that's actually what makes them so comfortable that they're so light and flexible and along with the super soft foam on the top band and the super soft leather ear cushions that go over your ears all this combines together to make,2.48,621.843,142.321
Marques Brownlee,DAxj9CjczXw,Earphone,Competitor,them really comfortable if anything the qc35s are just a little bit heavier than the 25s since there's now a small rechargeable battery in them now but you probably won't notice that so wearing these headphones for long periods of time like a long flight is still no problem comfort is a huge plus for these now since they're wireless you do have a couple other things to worry about and those are the controls and battery life controls have moved from the inline wire and mic on the qc25s to buttons on the back of the right ear cup here and they're all the same so the play pause controls the volume up and down skipping tracks etc and they're all pretty tactile quality buttons which is important when you're pressing them blind and battery life is also top of the line now i've only had these for the past couple days of about the past week or so but the 20 hour active battery life seems to hold up now every time you turn them on it tells you when the bluetooth is paired and it also gives you the battery percentage of what's left so when i turn it on last i had was 63 so i feel like i could finish out the rest of the week with a lot more heavy listening of these and not have to,74.24,621.843,129.119
Marques Brownlee,DAxj9CjczXw,Earphone,Competitor,charge it till the weekend so that's good and i feel like if you could listen to pair of headphones for the entire week and charge it once a week with a lot of heavy listening you pretty much don't have to think about it that much so battery life is another strong point with these now sound quality is pretty much exactly the same as the qc25s which is to say pretty good but nothing spectacular it's nothing that's going to blow your mind at all it's just like a normal pair of closed bag headphones you aren't buying these to monitor for music production or anything like that they're obviously very vibrant and colored and i'd put them on par with other 150 to 300 headphones in terms of clarity and detail but again it's wireless so that's nice and it actually comes with a wire in the box on the bottom of these headphones you have a micro usb charging port on the right ear cup and yes you do get that mini cable and a three and a half millimeter headphone jack on the left ear cup and that wire is included to either plug it into something that doesn't have bluetooth and just listen to them like normal headphones or plug it in and use the headphones without noise cancellation so if you just want regular,138.879,621.843,120.72000000000003
Marques Brownlee,DAxj9CjczXw,Earphone,Competitor,listening with no noise cancellation you have to do it through the wire but you can't do it wirelessly and then the noise cancellation itself bose does this pretty much better than anyone else it's kind of what they're best at there's microphones as you can see all around the outsides of the headphones to pick up outside noise and frequencies and just cancel them out so if you've heard bose noise cancelling headphones before you know exactly what i'm talking about it's great for flights it's great for loud environments trains buses basically anytime you want to cancel out the outside world and just hear your audio just listening to your music isolated i mean that's why you buy noise-canceling headphones in the first place so i'm happy to say that bose has put together a complete package here with the qc35s they'll be replacing my qc25s uh it even has things like nfc built in for quick bluetooth pairing by tapping it to your android phone so that was convenient and there's the carrying case as well that's pretty similar to the one the qc25s had since they fold up the exact same way plus they carry extra cables now too and again that's ideal for traveling and just tossing the headphones in a bag or a backpack or,198.879,621.843,131.04
Marques Brownlee,DAxj9CjczXw,Earphone,Competitor,something and there's the flying adapter too since they know that people use these a lot on planes so coming back to that price difference basically if you want to have specifically noise cancelling wireless headphones then you have to pay the extra 50 bucks to go with the 35s but if you just want noise cancelling headphones and you don't really care about the convenience of having no wire then this is just fine the 25s are functionally pretty much exactly the same as the qc35s no wire slightly shorter battery life single aaa battery also has a wire 50 bucks cheaper for the 25s that's your breakdown but bottom line is if you're looking for noise canceling headphones in general in a premium sort of 300 price range you should have these on your short list either way that's been it thank you for watching if you have any other suggestions for headphones or audio products or anything else tech related you want me to take a look at feel free to leave it in the comments section right below that like button and i'll be down there answering your questions as well that's been it thanks for watching and i'll talk to you guys in the next one peace,267.12,621.843,125.841
Unbox Therapy,stJd03ZnRwE,Earphone,Apple,we're talking about apple products though and this came open right away oh yeah it's a better fit than the regular airpods for my ears check the look sick not the strongest connection which might be the sweet spot i don't know oh we have volume it's really weird that it's there's a lot of cross over here who who who said they're almost the same we have some air pods today the new airpods that's the confusing part isn't it airpods third generation not pro they still have the pro they still have the second generation these are the third generation a slight improvement over the second generation but you're gonna pay more money i have the canadian price on this particular package 239 dollars so it's still a premium price who's it for it's for somebody who wants some of the pro features without an ear tip style design this also has the magsafe charging case which i think is a pretty cool improvement for convenience and such so this can just snap onto apple's magnetic magsafe there's a thing going on with the word magsafe and how it applies to the variety of magnetic apple products because there's like iphone magsafe and then there's the new mag safe charger which is really kind of like the old magsafe charger for the laptops anyway point being is you can magnetically charge these which is a nice touch as well oh also i have new uh later case just like this one airpods third generation 100 dupont kevlar same fit as this one so you can pick that up order that up if you're going to be getting the third generation airpods and another quick preview before i jump into the box i got the new g-shock watch smartwatch android wear i haven't worn a g-shock in a long time but if you've been around the channel you know i used to love these things wear os by google plus casio g-shock rugged and stuff gsw h1000 made in japan so that's a bonus round after we do the airpods now the shape of it they change so even though it's not interchangeable ear tips it is a sort of a more bulbous looking shape to it still has your toothbrush stem looking situation however the stem is a little bit shorter on this one as well easy unboxing experience you know how this goes zip and zip also come with spatial audio so airpods 3 are going to have the spatial audio feature from the airpods pro standard airpods never had it however active noise cancellation continues to be the biggest difference that's going to be exclusive to the pricier model with the pro designation you've been using the airpods pro recently any thoughts on that i love them oh my god the noise cancellation is amazing noise cancellation he says amazing he's trying to get mo out of his life at least the noise that mo is making which is frequent and constant maybe the dog moe's not that loud himself a little bit of paperwork inside the package touch controls obviously on the side of the stem play pause skip tracks and siri if you'd like to use it the case is a little bit,0.32,621.843,388.03700000000015
Unbox Therapy,stJd03ZnRwE,Earphone,Apple,larger than regular airpods as you can see but not quite as large as the pro model that's interesting we peel this and this came open right away still going to have your lightning connector on the bottom for charging it up you're still going to have your led on the front it's all very familiar look at the two-tone black and white look pull out the pro bud and pull out the third generation bud they're so comparable in appearance that's crazy it's almost like the new third generation bud is simply missing the nozzle and that's it if i pull off the little adapter in-ear adapter look how similar those look the pro model versus the third generation although the speaker portion the port is larger on the pro model still and actually the entire earbud is larger on the pro model still let's try this on let's get an idea of some comfort here right left now one benefit of not having a nozzle like this is you have a fit that's a i don't know what to call it more of a casual fit if you're going for the opposite end of the spectrum from noise cancelling maybe more towards transparency then this is just naturally more transparent because it's not sitting in my ear canal so i can even hear myself speaking i never had trouble with the original air pods and the fit there but some people say it falls out of their ears you were complaining about that in the past i don't think anything's really going to compete with the pro model for fit because it's in the ear canal oh yeah it's a better fit than the regular airpods for my ears yeah this this is this is loose this is more loose it's a smaller it's a way smaller earbud where's the charge pad the apple charge all right well well moe goes to get the uh the magsafe charger so we can look at the connection of this thing also in the package you have a typical traditional cable option on this end it's still going to be lightning now as far as the case is concerned let's see how that fits on well no adhesive necessary it's a friction fit so that just goes bang like that and you still have access to the button and bingo check the look sick okay so we have the apple official magsafe charger this is just going to stick when it gets there you see the orange light comes on it's charging it's not the strongest connection but it doesn't really have to be because you're not really going to be using the case while it's on there not like the phones which have to make a sort of stronger grasp because you're going to be using the phone and yes it does work as well with the case on it still sticks oh and charges i also think with this new design they're going to get a little bit less disgusting i don't know why that is but like with the earwax and stuff the in-ear is going to be the worst for that these were kind of bad for that because they had a really small nozzle as well this one with the like bigger opening i think it's going to be easier to clean it out and get the debris out of there that's,197.44,621.843,358.96099999999996
Unbox Therapy,stJd03ZnRwE,Earphone,Apple,just a little side thing all right so there's an update preparing here ios 15.1 all right we're back it is uh another day because this one we left it updating it was like the world's longest update for some reason 15.1 prores i blame prores anyway it doesn't matter because we're back and that's the main thing and now we are finally gonna get to listen to the third generation of air pods which might be the sweet spot i don't know if it's in between these two and so you save a little bit of money on this one you pay a little more than this one how are they gonna sound i'm gonna compare i'm gonna listen to these and then the pros can they replace the pros should you get them instead of the pros do you need noise cancellation all right so right away of course we get our wonderful air airpod connection prompt i am connected now i just gotta be honest with you it is almost no isolation i have music playing piano music somehow right away where is this music coming from that's my apple music oh it's your apple music i was like what is going on here it's funny when you're marketing spatial audio i never imagined there's also i mean you end up with the the activity of spatializing i've already demonstrated spatial audio with the pro models it is magical i it sounds stupid it sounds so stupid it feels like i'm a i don't know how the software oh that's a switch we're in kirk's library right now they sound better than these little earpods it's it's there's a thickness there's a thickness to it sound better than those oh this is a banging album you're going to love this album it's a comfortable uh earbud it's a day to day it's an everyday i don't know about lone star rag but definitely when we had the drake on there okay fine wow this is my like 2016 in a bottle right here lots of volume too hey with like the ear health care turned off oh we have volume i like having more volume than i need and then just like allow me to you know i mean like as far as the volume is concerned i need to be able to manage these things somehow there's just like a little bit of uh punch lacking just a tiny touch uh maybe i should just do an a b test right now same track no they're not even close to as good as the pros no not even close people are saying people are saying what they're pretty close people are saying what i don't know who you're talking to i don't know who you've been chatting with i got buds flying over here flying buds but here's the thing all right all right let me just if you don't mind let me just uh give you my take here i have no idea why you would buy uh unless you absolutely hate having things in your ear sit deeply in your ear,377.36,621.843,375.597
Unbox Therapy,stJd03ZnRwE,Earphone,Apple,if the ear tip in the ear canal drives you nuts that's the one reason i think you should look at the airpods third generation that's pretty much it because these are better have more features and they're not that much more money if you're already close to two bills on the earbuds i guess the wireless charging is a nice little touch i don't know what kind of value that brings for you but uh you're so close to picking up these or uh finding them for slightly less on a discount or something i guess the case is a little bit smaller get the pro that's it it's easy that's easy get the pro yep i'm sold i'm resold if this is what you're considering these are your options get the pro yeah i mean they're fine i mean they're fine get the pro skip these ones get the pro which one should i get i think you might you know what i gave it some more thought here i think maybe go for the pro i'm guessing that apple still sells a lot of these and people are intimidated like that there must be a reason why they feel like this this product needs to exist in the middle of these two maybe this thing's on the way out they're going to hang on to it for just a short period of time maybe the holiday season whatever one more generation because they have an abundance of inventory or it's easier to make right now because of shortages or shipping or covet or whatever i don't think this design is necessarily going to be there forever things i just feel this product makes more sense when you don't also have this one as an option because they're so similar that's all it's home get the pro skip these ones get the pro i don't know if you guys noticed kanye he shaved his eyebrows he's been wearing these around well moe wants a later case shout out yeah that might be one of my favorite later case products the way those fit on the airpods max get the pro let's check out this new watch how about that uh a g-shock that has wear os it can work in uh like a light power consumption mode as a pretty typical g-shock which i like sometimes i don't want smart features don't need heart rate and i don't want to drain battery so you can go for much longer periods of time when you're in sort of dumb mode and then flip into smart mode when i don't know you need to track heart rate or something like that and i typically don't want notifications on my wrist so that's a cool compromise or that's a cool hybrid type of setup they're so rugged you slam it into something and you don't you're not concerned anyway built into this one shock resistant heart rate gps altimeter barometer compass and also some water resistance as well as you would expect in a rugged watch like this i love the old school japanese digital watch unboxing,599.36,621.843,356.4800000000001

Unbox Therapy,Fl4Djf5Vr0I,Earphone,Apple,do you understand how deeply entrenched you will become if you dare make this purchase these things live to sell and keep you and hold you constrained within the apple ecosystem you will never climb out of it i promise [Music] you [Music] [Applause] and it gets scary when you start to think about what apple might pull off with this thing right you could have specific mixes set up in advance by the artist or producer for the headset you're listening to who else has the power who else has the connections and the handshakes necessary to potentially deliver that i'm just talking right now it finally happened i finally got my hands on the brand new air pods max from apple that's a lot of them as well i couldn't just get one not at this point i had been waiting so long i was like you know what i want to show the people every single color because i kind of think it's a big part of apple's identity right now is the color selection whether it's phones or headphones we're just seeing so many options and it's uh well it's it's tickling people in all the right ways i just wanted to show them all to you and i thought why don't we have an unboxing extravaganza so we do have the green we do have the pink we do have the silver what do they call this one space gray i mean it's not quite black yeah they call it space gray and then we also have the blue ones over here on the right and by the way i picked up the super premium lightning to 3.5 millimeter audio jack cable because this doesn't come in the box unfortunately if you do you want to use a wired connection in order to listen to audio and i read that you cannot use third-party cables this is a specialty cable that is necessary for this purpose you can't use just a regular uh lightning to mini jack that you would find on amazon you need apples cable and they'll recommend it to you when you go to purchase one of these you're saying 550 lou you're saying excuse me i'd like to have a cable and all the various adapters truthfully i don't think apple even wants you to use this i think they want you to be fully wireless these things these headphones are ultimately going to perform their best and be in their zone when they're used with ios devices using an old-fashioned analog connection i don't know it just doesn't seem seem nearly as futuristic i'm gonna just i'm gonna just unbox some of these i'm gonna listen maybe to a couple of them and i'm gonna get to the bottom of this whole thing that's the purpose of this and i'm coming with a fresh mind i'm come with an open mind i did watch a few videos but uh you know what i'm gonna try to treat it as clean as possible here the box a very simple experience oh my goodness i just exposed the most controversial component in the unboxing experience and well just to go with the product in general the smart case purse looking thing which whoa it just has people all fired up it has the whole community just right fired up they can't take it they can't stand it i don't even care that much you know it's funny maybe everybody else got angry enough for me that i don't feel the need to get angry all over again one thing that does kind of bug me is the fact that in order to put the,1.599,621.843,411.961
Unbox Therapy,Fl4Djf5Vr0I,Earphone,Apple,headphones immediately into low power mode you do have to insert them into the case instead of having some sort of manual turn off switch now they will eventually go to sleep after five minutes if they're laying on the table without the case this is something apple didn't really make clear initially and then uh they put out a statement i think today actually stating that that would take place i wish there was some kind of manual override or an option a little toggle switch if you did want these things to go to sleep a bit faster depending on the way that you use them but anyways get used to the fact that you now you're a purse guy you paid a lot of money here look at this no that wasn't that could have been better there we go you paid a lot of money you paid 550 well i paid more than 550 but if you buy this you paid 550 dollars my goodness okay strong scent strong scent um smells like industry it smells like a trillion dollar company on the holidays uh let me take this out here oh it is heavy i have heard this people saying man they're a bit heavy you got like 100 grams on top of those world famous xm4s from sony which i personally use and i can tell the weight difference right away i don't know how much of it is the case but [Laughter] i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm not all right look listen i'm giving it a fair shake it's just it's so funny that's the way they did that i don't know who presented it it must have been some senior level person a designer where they were like absolutely that's the future right there it's an accessory and you're going to own it with pride obviously many have mentioned within the scene that this doesn't do some of the job you would expect for a case to do as far as protecting the device you have a lot of exposure around the ear cups here and the headband is fully exposed if you did throw this in a bag i mean that's some delicate mesh right there could get poked or something like that you don't have a pen in that bag it's got a lot of wrapping going on i'm gonna pull this out okay there's the head oh so the case also works to stop them from doing this which kind of funny they do that by default i wonder okay they tap each other yes so this is leather or i don't think so it does have a nice soft microfiber interior but all in all i mean i don't know what my expectation was for this material here it probably feels a little bit less robust than i expected look at these little protectors right here oh delicate you pop them out those are quite nice looking indicators stitched in right and left the ear pads themselves magnetically attach funny enough not funny enough not funny at all they'll sell you uh ear cups replacement ear cups or different color ear cups for i believe 69 which is as much as some other wireless headphones so the design is nice maybe if it had of included an extra set in there we could have been uh very happy about that with the easy replacement as far as adjustment is concerned we have this little slidey aspect this little slidy piston piece so there's no clicking or ratcheting going on which is a nice touch it's all,216.239,621.843,436.9570000000001
Unbox Therapy,Fl4Djf5Vr0I,Earphone,Apple,metal and aluminum in the design very premium as we look around the device you'll see your lightning connector on the bottom to charge these up i think you can get like an hour and a half of usage out of a five minute charge so it does have some fast charging in there so there was some hope that these would go to usb type c because you might hold on to them for like five years and lightning is likely to be dead five years from now but anyway for now it's a lightning connector you also have microphones all over these things not just for noise cancellation but also for that transparency mode that i'm such a big fan of on a variety of headphone products that currently exist including apple's very own airpods pro interacting with the headphone is no touch controls on the outside instead it's going to be this digital crown it's similar to the watch but a bit larger it's kind of an unusual location so it's going to be on the the back side oh it's in it seems to be in transparency by default i hear my own voice so very clearly right now it's uncanny and there's no lag that transparency mode is likely superior to the transparency mode on my sony xm4s i have to say uh so initial impressions there they're definitely comfortable i should try without the hat as well i want to test this mesh headband it's a little wider than your typical headband and it does help but it is a heavy headphone it's a heavy headphone i'll tell you that right now i've tried a number of headphones but it is comfortable it is comfortable as of right now also inside the package you've got your usual paperwork there's no apple stickers or anything like that below that we have our only accessory in the package which is a lightning to usb type c cable that's how you charge these up you need to bring your own power brick to the party something tells me if you can afford the 550 on the headphones uh the 35 for the cable is not gonna set you set you off if you need it i mean i'm just saying it's sad but true why don't we go for something more flashy now like this pink color the official name here pink with red headband interesting hmm you're an idiot lou all right i'm just calling it a purse i mean that's what it looks like it's the kind of direction that red has gone for apple with the phones and things it keeps on moving towards an orangish coral thing pink thing but in this case the actual headphones are kind of a nice tone it's a like a rose metallic type of color are people going to flex these headphones that is the question are we going to see them flexed in public or is it just strictly an at-home flex do you flex to yourself in the mirror maybe uh i could just snap off the right ear ear cup on the pink one and the right ear cup on the silver one and i mean you could even go one and one i mean we're talking about style after all we're talking about flexing uh this could be the ultimate scenario it's quite possible i wasn't gonna select this one if i could only get one because to me it's an unusual color for a gadget and it's darker the headband is actually darker than i expected it to be that's a nice you could call that a nice blue alright so that's the space gray and yeah and that's too too tough to say no to,445.039,621.843,452.39900000000006
Unbox Therapy,Fl4Djf5Vr0I,Earphone,Apple,for me it's just simple if you were gonna design this thing and draw it on and draw it up in advance i don't know i just feel like it will probably come out of your head in space gray it is only green that remains to be seen now this one [Music] is interesting that is very minty that headband is the mintiest green i've ever seen in my entire life so that is an interesting color combo can't say i would buy it however it has some attitude to it it has an energy to it which is not pink and not blue because those two energies are well understood the pink and blue energy the green energy is far more mysterious and then it's almost all of inside the ear cups i mean it they're crazy how do they make all these choices this one the case is it just not even like the ear cup or the headband this case is its own thing it's like an army green almost so the green ones are definitely the wild card and uh there's nothing wrong with that i guess we might as well open up the cable because i have been told that this is a special cable and this is why you cannot use the third-party cables that exist out there i don't know if there's a dac inside of this cable or why it unlocks this functionality where the others don't is it more intelligent this cable is it made by apple this game so it is a thin wire i don't know how long is that that's about four feet if you did want to you would be doing this and then that now oh you know where you would have to use this is if you were going to fly in an airplane and you wanted to connect to the entertainment system on the airplane it typically you're not going to be able to connect via wireless so you would use this into here into the airplane setup or maybe possibly still need to go into a secondary adapter from here i'm glad they at least make this but it's a bit of a sting certainly that you gotta pay 35 extra you know what maybe they should have just put this in the box just for what it for what it is maybe they should have just put that in the box this costs apple one dollar to make i would assume okay yes apple magic you see that is 550 that's what it's all about right there i'm into the noise cancellation right now my own voice is very muffled kirk's test is barely there i mean if it's it's it's cancelled but it's not complete fishbowl cancelled it's just one button it's either noise canceling or transparency and it's a single tap they tried to simplify it the only other control i think you have yeah you have that control and then you have your volume toggle which makes a clicky noise to it which is actually a little bit satisfying it's a lot going on there's all kinds of little enhancements happening and it's very difficult because how could you make the most out of a wireless experience if you've just admitted okay fine it's going to be wireless and apple's way is by putting smart chips inside of each ear cup in order to do the computational magic variety of eq and spatial awareness and all the rest of it to try to enhance your experience that's all fine and well when it comes to consumption when you're trying to get immersed in an experience when you're trying to watch a movie yeah give me the magic tricks but if i'm trying to wear these things,676.8,621.843,474.79999999999995
Unbox Therapy,Fl4Djf5Vr0I,Earphone,Apple,on the final cut pro timeline you get a little bit worried about whether you're hearing the actual thing or not because there's all kinds of uh well i can hear the eq i can hear the interpretation and the enhancements but i'm on the winter wonderland track that's johnny mathis right there and it feels magical right now okay let me let me go do the pop music i know you you guys want me to do the pop music i don't know what's the song of the year a lot of rumble a lot of low end i mean that's what they're doing right that's what they're doing i mean they scooped it out in the middle those are the tactics that gives you that dynamics that's what the average person they pick up a pair of headphones they say oh that sounds what if i go and you know into something some classical or something this experience here doesn't feel like a 550 experience question is if i were in apple music i'm not apple music subscriber am i i just signed up to apple music for you guys all right i probably didn't even have to do that but whatever i don't think this thing is tuned up for uh you know some mozart but i'm just gonna go out and say in this limited experience right here this is a you know electronic pop music it's a 20 20 thing for the most part right now however however let's not forget my reaction to my first experience with spatial audio technology which is completely unique to the category oh ah if i turn my head bane is talking in the movie but bain stays here baine is always here and your brain is doing some weird analysis of the how realistic the source of audio is based on your ability to pinpoint your impression of where that source exists it sounds so subtle and unnecessary but when you experience it it's like it's something to it it's a movie theater it's a movie theater in your pocket that's the killer functionality that's the killer feature as far as i'm concerned that's the big difference maker compared to anything else that i've tried however i do need to try the wire i did spend 35 dollars on a lightning to mini jack cable so i might as well try it see if anything changes this part where does that go and then does it automatically switch over i wonder we go like this we go back on yeah i might be able to tell a little bit of a difference on the wire uh it might sound a little bit better to me on the wire holy moly comprehensive i don't know this is it's such a tough product right it's like to come into a new segment like over the ear headphones and to come in at a price point of 550 with your first product it just feels a little bit conceited and particularly in 2020 where it's like maybe the disposable income isn't so readily available right now as a headphone sitting here today i can't possibly tell most people to go out and spend 550 on it it's just not going to change your life in a 550 way it's not gonna feel like a new playstation if you're on a fence you do not need to run out and get it if you already knew you wanted it before you clicked on it you still want it and you should probably just find a way to get it i guess that's how this whole thing works isn't it i don't know you like something you get it feels special for a minute uh i've been doing that for a while it's called unbox therapy probably gonna keep doing it,930.88,621.843,451.35999999999996
Unbox Therapy,mUNvvXvcQTs,Earphone,Apple,[Music] foreign [Music] wow holy music video vibes on the airpods max my goodness gracious we have a new apple product many questions my timeline is exploding with comments around these airpods max no they're not gonna be called the studio they're gonna fall in line with those uh phone titles with the uh pro max but they're not pro but they didn't get the pro they just got the max part but it doesn't really matter the main thing here is now apple is in the over ear headphone business prior to these we had these this little thing that to this day looks like some sort of tiny little dental floss and you see it everywhere then they came out with these ones right here these of course are the airpods pro they put the pro designation in there and these things upgraded this experience they added an in-ear design and some software functionality including this spatial audio which actually i did an entire video on and it kind of i'll be honest it knocked my socks off i was very happy with it now these existed at a certain price point they were premium but not crazy premium the new air pods max ladies and gentlemen are coming in at 549 now for wireless bluetooth headphones that is very expensive you will see many people in the tech space here on youtube referencing these headphones right here these are the sony xm series headphones uh these ones are the xm4s but the xm3s were great i mean i've been using these things forever and they have many of the features that apple has now put into the airpods max including transparency if you want to hear your surroundings including eq and of course active noise cancellation is in there as well and over your design and the ability to use a wire if you choose to now one of the advantages these have they charge over usb type c which is a universal port those airpods max are not going to do that and then here's the most important part,7.75,621.843,266.61100000000005
Unbox Therapy,mUNvvXvcQTs,Earphone,Apple,these headphones exist and in this universe many people love these headphones however you're going to pay a lot less than what you're gonna pay for these airpods max in fact let me just go and do a quick peek right now why don't i sony xm4 you could pick these up right now for 278 dollars on sale now the original retail price was 349 but 278 that means these things are almost half the price actually less than half right around half the price so there are so many questions right now yes of course i went ahead and ordered the airpods max but many of you right now are trying to figure out if you should pre-order as well because we're already seeing those delivery dates slip as crazy as that sounds there's gonna be some people sitting there saying man for 550 you're crazy for 550 i could get a playstation 5. what am i doing with these headphones people in that camp as well saying i got a smartphone i didn't pay 550 for and then you got people in the other camp the enthusiasts deeply embedded in the apple ecosystem who say this is exactly what i wanted and here's something that's important to keep in mind this is an exclusive product part of the appeal of it is the knowing that most people won't have it the status the luxury component now i'm not making an argument for the luxury component but you can't deny that it exists and previously we experienced something much like that with the beats brand which now seems to have shrunk a little bit underneath the apple organization it's turned into i don't know more of a budget brand the most recent release they put out was a more affordable wireless headset and now this ultra premium headset lives underneath the apple brand could it be a stair or a step or a stool for the apple brand to elevate itself within audio i mean we've seen the success with the other airpods products maybe so so they do come in a number of different colors,148.16,621.843,237.76000000000002
Unbox Therapy,mUNvvXvcQTs,Earphone,Apple,and it's i mean part of this is as much about styling it's as much about the apparel component as i mean this is a thing that you wear on the outside of your body and it's allowed the headphone business and headphone segment to really develop in recent years as this representation of some kind of style for the individual that wears it they come in silver black blue it's like a sky blue there's also a pink and a green and of course the colors are somewhat inspired by the phone colors because it would be very hard to believe that anyone would be in the market for these airpods max and not be an iphone owner see that's the thing you have the h1 chip in here you have the spatial audio feature this hardware software combination is really only at home on an ios or mac device if you're using a macbook or let's say an iphone or let's say an ipad now you've got the fast switching between devices now you're on the ipad and you have the spatial audio experience which is a special and unique and exclusive experience and i can't tell you what price you should pay to go and have that experience on an over ear headphone you need to figure that out for yourself i think for the average person this is going to be a way too much cash it's not i mean the cost of performance is not going to live here it is going to be a luxury the question is how many people are in for a luxury how many people are prepared to splurge on the luxury for themselves in 2020 given all the various global circumstances you know things that are going on but i haven't heard them yet maybe they sound magical as apple likes to say that's quite possible as well now the big key with these upcoming headphones they supposedly have computational audio with a powerful apple design h1 chip in each cup custom acoustic design and advanced software airpods macs use computational audio to create a breakthrough listening,266.72,621.843,234.47999999999996
Unbox Therapy,mUNvvXvcQTs,Earphone,Apple,experience tapping into each chip's 10 audio course computational audio helps block outside noise adapts audio to the fit and seal of your ear cushions and makes movie scenes sound like they're happening all around you so this is a different tag line for all the smart things that your headphones are capable of including the spatial audio including the adaptive eq and including the noise cancellation which again other headphones do this it's important to note but you know apple they put their spin on it and they typically with these technologies just bring them to a user base that may be unfamiliar with their existence in pre-existing products now the other thing you get with that h1 chip is this really easy pairing across ios and mac devices it's as simple as popping the headphones out of their case and then boom it shows up on your phone speaking of the case my goodness how about the meme town that is the actual case which looks like a purse of course they couldn't take a typical approach you hold on to the headband kind of as the handle and the headphones then go into a ultra low power mode in order to save power for when you need it next they don't fold up they kind of just fold out and then end up in this sort of unusual purse contraption as far as battery life apple is claiming that they're going to be capable of 20 hours of listening with noise cancellation enabled now one little downside for myself is the fact that they're going to be using a lightning cable so they had the opportunity here to shift over to usb type c but i presume that would be a difficult decision given the fact that these products the airpods pro and the regular air pods airpods with wireless charge case airpods too they all use the lightning connector so they probably want to keep it cohesive through these devices as well as the phones but you do have some devices that switched over to type c like those ipads and of course the laptops so that would have been nice to see on the pro model the other thing that's a,384.0,621.843,235.11899999999997
Unbox Therapy,mUNvvXvcQTs,Earphone,Apple,bit strange if you do go to order these you'll have an option for an add-on an add-on audio cable if you want to use them in a non-wireless fashion which is very useful and often included with a pair of headphones like these it seems to me that with these upcoming airpods max it's going to be one port which is that lightning port and if you do want to use it in an analog fashion and which many people do with a high-end headphone then you're going to need this lightning to mini jack cable that they sell separately and in canadian dollars it was like 45 bucks all right listen here it is this is the breakdown it's an apple product apple products are expensive apple products are luxury not all the time but a lot of the time and this is not a product that anyone needs and i think that apple draws that distinction now by need i mean want or i mean the comparison between a need and a want they recently put out the m1 laptop products and i think that entry-level macbook air is one of the best values in computers right now given some of the initial testing that i've done this product is the opposite this product is obviously extra but it's kind of extra on purpose for those people who are the most enthusiastic apple fans and they want to wear the device that is the most indicative of that it's like a different seat in the stadium this is the luxury seat this is i got this because i can type a territory does that mean it's justified well for those people it is i'm not mad about it you can be mad about it if you want but that's the nature of this thing and it's the nature of apple in 2020. chances are the xm4s remain a better value but that said 250 is expensive for headphones too and there's plenty of great values around 100 bucks so keep that in mind as well there's tiers to this thing and the cost of entry to the airpods max is a little higher than i might have expected but i'm not really all that surprised,501.44,621.843,241.79900000000004
Unbox Therapy,9Iwiji7oli4,Earphone,Apple,ah are you blind why are you walking like that did you try this oh my God I it sounds stupid it sounds so stupid it feels like I don't know how the software so a new feature recently launched on these guys right here the airpods pro I knew I had to test it out because I recall watching the keynote next let's talk about airpods in which they announced this particular feature facial audio I mean it felt like something interesting it looked like something interesting I couldn't feel it yet I was just watching the keynote you know the experience of being in a movie theater one where the sound not only comes from in front of you but also from the left the right behind and even from above you the way this basically works is that with the latest software update so you have IOS 14 and then you have this is the important part the latest software on your airpods pro as well it will create a a spatial awareness kind of surround sound experience which is relative to your head and the device that you're holding we can Place sounds virtually anywhere in space now not all devices are supported you need a relatively recent iOS device in order to take advantage of this as well and then it's going to take some serious magic to get your airpods pro to update because there's no way to force a firmware update to these things you kind of have to just leave them nearby and leave them opened up and it took in our case like an hour I don't know it's it's Apple Magic going on Siri had to be enabled there's a little Pro tip so for some reason enabling Siri help to update the airpods pro what you're looking for is version 3a283 at least at the time of filming this video okay so after you've done that this will enable the spatial audio toggle and the support for spatial audio in a number of different apps in which you would typically have surround sound content Dolby content 5.1 or 7.1 content so there's also a little demo just to give me a taste of what it's going to be like so I'm going to pop open oh by the way this doesn't work on regular airpods not really sure why we had them here just to just to rub it in that if you have regular airpods don't expect to utilize this feature I'll just go ahead and put them right in my ear right now [Music] by default I mean this is stuff that you've seen before in these settings you have noise cancellation and you have transparency transparency is going to allow the microphones on these devices to let sound pass through so I'll click that for a moment just as a quick reminder this lets you have a conversation lets you hear your surroundings I've Loved this feature on headphones dating back a number of years now actually and I'm glad that it exists,0.0,621.843,336.5799999999999
Unbox Therapy,9Iwiji7oli4,Earphone,Apple,now in an Apple airpods product I think for the kind of optimal spatial audio experience I'm going to go back to noise cancellation mode anyway we scroll down here and now you've unlocked this spatial audio setting so I'm going to go ahead and click the see and hear how it works here immersive three-dimensional audio from supported videos that follows the movement of your phone obviously you have various sensors capable of knowing where the phone is in relationship to your head that's that kind of synergy as they say in the well that's the corporate lingo but I think ecosystem is the more more frequent terminology in the tech realm anyway see and hear how it works all right well first up you got stereo audio this is your typical earbud functionality so now I'm going to click the spatial audio button oh all right now what happens if I'm oh yeah you're right the Shaker is what you want to pay attention to if you're testing this yourself there's like a it stays here the Shaker is your phone now it's here but on this ear you know what I'm saying it's very complicated what if I turn all the way around yes behind me oh that is a bit creepy oh that's weird that is a different level of immersion you can imagine uh something scary with the creeping up and the sound effect behind all right don't mind me I'm just gonna get immersive over here foreign not supported yeah I got movies can I hit up like Batman or something oh yeah I see Dolby vision should I try it do it oh yeah yeah it's working oh that's so weird hold up oh all right all right all right all right all right all right all right right all right all right all right it is though it's cool it feels uh quite real for a voice on a screen to not move I could just be like having a talking to somebody responding to someone and it stays over here it is a very it's cool it's a cool headphone experience you know what it feels it just feels like sitting in a movie theater with the sound is mostly coming from the front and if you were to turn your head obviously it would change your brain's perception of the source of the sound see headphones if I got up and what happens if I get up and walk around are you blind I it sounds stupid it sounds so stupid I'm saying it feels like I'm in a movie theater it's like sure Lou get out of my face but it does it feels like I'm I don't know how the software,182.04,621.843,348.226
Unbox Therapy,9Iwiji7oli4,Earphone,Apple,is so sophisticated how have they replicated that experience so exactly in my tiny little ear can house what now I'm on an iPhone so I don't know this might be a little much for me if I was just on the public transport and I'm just zoned in over here but if I was chilling with the iPad or on a laptop my goodness what amazing what they can pull out of these tiny little earbuds and some some sophisticated software techniques it is holy I've tried surround sound virtualization in the past on full-scale headphones and to be fair I mean these are not the most advanced headphones I've ever tried but the combination the software relationship between the device the content and the earbuds has created a very uh realistic movie theater like or sit or never mind a movie theater but like a couch and a big TV and if you had a big stereo setup a big surround setup it really feels like that but I just have these tiny earbuds it also feels like the sound is out here somewhere like there's texture to it it's very strange it doesn't feel like it's in my buds it feels like it's coming from the from the screen wherever the screen is positioned it feels like the sound is halfway between me and the screen and at no point do you feel as though it's coming from your earbuds it feels like it feels like your earbuds are earplugs your brain is fully fooled it's incredible well done I don't know as far as a portable movie watching experience I think some people a lot of people tend to underestimate the sound component and this just adds a whole different level to the mobile movie watching experience I don't even really need to try an iPad I might as well since I have it here so the fast switching thing is another enhancement that's been made on the most recent software on the airpods pro and iOS 14. so I'm gonna just hit play over on the phone and see if it immediately switches because I was just on the iPad yes phone loud awesome and now I'm on the iPad sound coming through so you don't even have to think about it I mean obviously you have to pair it at some point or or you have to be logged into iCloud so it recognizes the devices but it's no it's instant [Music] whatever I love it I mean like I said I think I think this is a huge development I think they totally underplayed it which is not like Apple at all to be honest you would think they will make a huge deal of this but they just rolled it out as an extra feature they could have uh released a whole different set of earbuds based around this feature and maybe they will maybe they'll do a studio set something like this that has that feature built in but with a much bigger driver unit and,455.699,621.843,373.4789999999999
Unbox Therapy,9Iwiji7oli4,Earphone,Apple,an over ear style headphone if Apple were to do that you would assume that this experience would get Amplified to an even greater level but as it stands right now it's in their airpods Pro earbuds oh by the way also check out the later case on the airpods pro you might want to pick one of those up protects them plus you get the carbon fiber look so that just makes me all that much more excited for when Apple does do a real true over ear headphone and puts this software and in this program inside of it I mean that could be that could be a very immersive experience I brought this headphone over actually I'm kind of amazed I haven't looked at it yet because the previous version the xm3 was my go-to over ear style headphone I still prefer an over ear to an earbud in most circumstances uh now this has something in it called 360 reality audio which is going to kind of mimic the experience I just had but without the same level of sophistication however it's not tapping into the various sensors on the phone itself it doesn't have that that type of tie-in and therefore if I just turn my head away from the source it's not going to really change the experience which is such a key part of that airpods Pro spatial experience this is not a cheap headphone this is well within the premium segment it competes with the likes of the various Bose products and the Microsoft headphones that are out there and I don't know maybe even some beats products and definitely whenever Apple decides to do their own over years of course there is an application to go with it that lets you control all the various configurations for the sound signature which you can modify and the noise canceling and the rest of it everything fits into this handy carrying case it also has this mesh pocket on the outside it's a nice little touch with the Sony zipper here which has like a kind of plating on it it looks bronze or rose gold oh we cracked that open and we have our headphones once again these are the blacked out version but the same color that you sort of saw on the zipper is carried through on the Sony logo and a couple of the headphone elements these things I can wear these things for hours on end without ear fatigue it is a lightweight headphone for what it is and also you have these super comfortable cushions in there you have a right and left designation one of the rumors with the upcoming Apple Studio headphones is that you'll be able to put them on either way and based on once again the involvement of the phone it will be able to tell which ear should be fed the Left Channel signal and which ears should be fed the right channel signal we have some buttons on the outside there's a custom configurable button over here your power switch with an LED light up above that,645.72,621.843,358.55800000000005
Unbox Therapy,9Iwiji7oli4,Earphone,Apple,here is the mini jack connector if you do choose to use this in a wired fashion there is a USB type-c connector over there and also an LED right beside it also in the package the tiniest little type c to USB a cable a little pocket for your airline adapter and your mini jack cable as well it all fits in very nicely and then the control scheme this is a touch panel on the side later okay next oh playing 360 on your headphones enables audio immersion yeah so this is cool this this sort of spreads out the sound so it's a much bigger stage and it feels as though you are more like at a live venue I suppose as opposed to being enclosed in a headset foreign oh that's very upsetting that's very upsetting I mean it's very upsetting why because software is so powerful man holy once you've had the experience once you had the spatial audio experience now I know I'm a b testing I literally I just did it and it's important to note these are probably my favorite headphones and certainly in most circumstances if I'm just listening to music or something I'm gonna rather have these on than these but just a b testing The Avengers end game audio experience spatial thing is for Real I mean it's not these don't they don't sound bad I need explosion or something they sound good the problem is they sound like headphones these things trick your brain completely let me just hold up yeah that's just stereo the 360 component is only supported in certain music applications and even there it's not as sophisticated because it's just surrounding you uh it's doing some guesswork whereas this is using real real math yeah it's a different it's a different experience I mean this is still a full-fledged headphone so everything has a little more maybe richness or or Bass to it but this feels like a movie theater it feels like I'm sitting in a movie theater and it's addictive if you have an iPhone if you have an iPad if you're if you're fully in the thing and you don't have airpods Pro this is as soon as you get you you can get these for Christmas I guess and the first thing you need to do is try out this spatial audio thing because it really is much different from the other headphone experiences that I have this is not for music it's specifically for watching content that supports it but uh it takes even a champion status headphone like this and makes me want to put it down when I boot up the movie that supports the spatial audio that's it's a pretty significant thing so anyways I'm still going to use these on the day-to-day but man when you pop a movie on all of a sudden what now I'm now I'm reaching for uh an iPad sounds going on here sheesh spatial audio Apple did something cool,824.579,621.843,403.10200000000003
Unbox Therapy,p5aaOtJ0PyU,Earphone,Apple,all right it's a new player in the fully wireless headphone space was alongside the launch of the new note stuff from samsung people were paying attention to the leak because these things they look like little beans buds live what what's the live referring to are they alive is it better for live music but these ones are cool because the shape is different think i might even have this cool new color mystic bronze so it doesn't tell me the color on the side so i'm going to compare these as well i should mention i have regular air pods which are kind of in this same price category however these don't have any noise canceling around 150 for these 169 for those but these ones do add noise cancellation they're saying it's active noise cancellation ergonomic fit 6 to 21 hours of play time akg sound also apparently there's a big focus with these on base performance so if you're into bass heavy music a little bit of paperwork over here by the looks of it it's a quick start guide is that the mystic bronze i think so yeah it's got that little that nice little hue to it very condensed efficient packaging likely some ear tips no yes yes the shape of these things is it's a new one for me so we'll see how uh we'll see how these things fit type c to usb type a no power brick you definitely have a smartphone if you're buying these headphones right matte finish in the color to match your possibly your galaxy note and you pop it open and there's your buds now the whole thing has a really lightweight feel to it these are very reflective and they're tiny little bean like things i'm gonna pull them out and if i want to put this piece on where do i even do i just i don't even know how this thing's gonna fit into my ear,0.08,621.843,237.68100000000004
Unbox Therapy,p5aaOtJ0PyU,Earphone,Apple,how do i oh the ear tip is actually hooking onto the cartilage portion of your ear and the whole thing sits on the outside of your ear maybe this is the best point of these they fit so perfectly into the ear at least for me it fits in there in a subtle fashion and in the mystic bronze it really blends in for me and you kind of forget that you're wearing it now we got to hear the sound obviously see how that goes now there is an app that goes along with these things the galaxy ware app where you manage all your various galaxy devices now this explains to me how to wear them you slide the front portion in first and then as i mentioned the rubber piece that's on there which can be replaced with these ones is hooking into the cartilage section of the ear creating that that tight fit like for me it's not they're not going anywhere let's turn on the active noise cancellation see how that works okay it's doing something test i mean i hear you jack part of the frequency of your voice has been filtered and here's where i think the limitation of active noise cancelling exists on earbuds like this because there's not much of a seal inside the ear canal i'm still i'm going to hear things you know what i mean the airpods pro you pull that out that sits deep in the ear canal it seals it off so then when you put the active noise cancelling on it only has to do the rest of the job the seal does the initial portion it's much better than say the standard air pods but it's still not on the level of some real active noise canceling that sits inside the ear or goes all the way around the ear it has touch controls you tap for play pause you double tap for the next track or to answer a phone call you triple tap for the previous track,118.24,621.843,222.23899999999995
Unbox Therapy,p5aaOtJ0PyU,Earphone,Apple,and you touch and hold users choice you can change this this can do it this could be anything find my earbuds is kind of nice how does that work your earbuds will start beeping when you tap start oh that's pretty cool so let's go ahead and listen to these i don't even know what i'm in for hmm there is bass yes there's definitely bass [Music] look for an earbud that's not deep in the ear that's there's some bass there i would say this has a dynamic type of performance particularly in the bass boost setting where you got like tremendous amount of punch and low end and then i'm hearing a lot of highs as well to go with it i don't think this is going to be a substitute for an in-ear style headphone like something like the airpods pro there's just they just have such an advantage by sitting so much further in the air and sealing you off from your surroundings if you're putting this up against the standard airpods then the conversation gets a bit more interesting because i think the sound is it's it's a tight match over there and obviously this has this is a preferable kind of form factor it's not a lot of external stuff it's just it's fit right in there assuming that it fits you well these are for electronic music these headphones are they're for electronic music [Music] i don't know how this is gonna fit people it fits me well it fits me good and and you don't have that same kind of like nastiness when you have an ear tip on there i think this is the comparison the standard airpods now let me just verify regular airpods are 159 159 versus 169 so really these are up against each other here this is what i should be testing out let,234.56,621.843,211.73099999999997
Unbox Therapy,p5aaOtJ0PyU,Earphone,Apple,me pair these up real quick and do it and do an a b test there's no noise cancellation at all on regular airpods here i'm i hear everything so let me go ahead to the same track and just do a sound comparison real quick i'm gonna say they're comparable obviously the uh noise cancellation helps a little bit on this but they sound wise it's hard to place one very high above the other the regular airpods might sound a little bit better if i had to be honest you know you probably want to just spend a few more bucks because you're pretty close price wise go up to the airpods pro and you get the best of both you have portability you have convenience and you're getting a sound performance improvement over actually either of these options over here that kind of maps it out for you oh and don't forget if you want to save some cash oneplus has you covered and you can go check out this video to uh to find out my feelings on this it's definitely cheaper the construction is cheaper the the sound is not on par but from a convenience standpoint it's equivalent i mean it's just as it's just as convenient as any of these it goes in the pocket it's fully wireless it actually kind of makes you wonder if you shouldn't just go with this if you're on a budget and then go all the way to this if you want to spend a little more there's so many options in this in this space it's exploded and options are a good thing probably my favorite thing about these guys is how tiny they are and the way they fit in the ear it feels futuristic but they will match your note series very nicely in mystic bronze this episode has been sponsored by lg x boom go the pl2 to start it off that's the most portable of the bunch pl 5 the larger pl7 which is probably going to have the most boom,353.6,621.843,222.31900000000002
Unbox Therapy,p5aaOtJ0PyU,Earphone,Apple,of the bunch now these little guys remind me jack you compare how many of these you can pair two together you can get a stereo setup if you're working with the pl2 but if you have the pl5 or the pl7 you can pair together up to 100 100 units this one is 24 hours of battery life 10 hours 18 hour they're all ipx5 water resistance there is an app that goes with this by the way it's available on ios and android oh this has a little bit of weight but i think this might boom i don't know jack it might boom so you have a little flex there because i think these are these woofers are about to woof the multi button the dual button the lighting button usb type c an auxiliary port and a usb type a port and pair up wonderful water setting forest or my style in which i can go in there and configure any color setup i want [Music] the lighting is dynamic so when you have it in party mode it's actually moving along to the music i mean that kind of that kind of says it all it's almost like a it's almost like a mini dvla let's do this now i can crack them both i'm going to do the dual mode so it's actually going to give me a stereo pair out of it man that was that's easy that was that was seamless to do i can move around you see what i'm saying twice the party you could pair 100 of these 100. all right so if you guys want to pick up any of these whether it's the big ones or the more portable size all you got to do is check the link in the description you can see the x boom for yourself i think you're going to be surprised at the amount of boom the amount of bass that you can get something that you can get out of something in this form factor right here so yeah check the description,464.479,621.843,251.39800000000002

Unbox Therapy,p5aaOtJ0PyU,Earphone,Competitor,and you touch and hold users choice you can change this this can do it this could be anything find my earbuds is kind of nice how does that work your earbuds will start beeping when you tap start oh that's pretty cool so let's go ahead and listen to these i don't even know what i'm in for hmm there is bass yes there's definitely bass [Music] look for an earbud that's not deep in the ear that's there's some bass there i would say this has a dynamic type of performance particularly in the bass boost setting where you got like tremendous amount of punch and low end and then i'm hearing a lot of highs as well to go with it i don't think this is going to be a substitute for an in-ear style headphone like something like the airpods pro there's just they just have such an advantage by sitting so much further in the air and sealing you off from your surroundings if you're putting this up against the standard airpods then the conversation gets a bit more interesting because i think the sound is it's it's a tight match over there and obviously this has this is a preferable kind of form factor it's not a lot of external stuff it's just it's fit right in there assuming that it fits you well these are for electronic music these headphones are they're for electronic music [Music] i don't know how this is gonna fit people it fits me well it fits me good and and you don't have that same kind of like nastiness when you have an ear tip on there i think this is the comparison the standard airpods now let me just verify regular airpods are 159 159 versus 169 so really these are up against each other here this is what i should be testing out let,234.56,621.843,211.73099999999997
Unbox Therapy,p5aaOtJ0PyU,Earphone,Competitor,me pair these up real quick and do it and do an a b test there's no noise cancellation at all on regular airpods here i'm i hear everything so let me go ahead to the same track and just do a sound comparison real quick i'm gonna say they're comparable obviously the uh noise cancellation helps a little bit on this but they sound wise it's hard to place one very high above the other the regular airpods might sound a little bit better if i had to be honest you know you probably want to just spend a few more bucks because you're pretty close price wise go up to the airpods pro and you get the best of both you have portability you have convenience and you're getting a sound performance improvement over actually either of these options over here that kind of maps it out for you oh and don't forget if you want to save some cash oneplus has you covered and you can go check out this video to uh to find out my feelings on this it's definitely cheaper the construction is cheaper the the sound is not on par but from a convenience standpoint it's equivalent i mean it's just as it's just as convenient as any of these it goes in the pocket it's fully wireless it actually kind of makes you wonder if you shouldn't just go with this if you're on a budget and then go all the way to this if you want to spend a little more there's so many options in this in this space it's exploded and options are a good thing probably my favorite thing about these guys is how tiny they are and the way they fit in the ear it feels futuristic but they will match your note series very nicely in mystic bronze this episode has been sponsored by lg x boom go the pl2 to start it off that's the most portable of the bunch pl 5 the larger pl7 which is probably going to have the most boom,353.6,621.843,222.31900000000002
Unbox Therapy,p5aaOtJ0PyU,Earphone,Competitor,of the bunch now these little guys remind me jack you compare how many of these you can pair two together you can get a stereo setup if you're working with the pl2 but if you have the pl5 or the pl7 you can pair together up to 100 100 units this one is 24 hours of battery life 10 hours 18 hour they're all ipx5 water resistance there is an app that goes with this by the way it's available on ios and android oh this has a little bit of weight but i think this might boom i don't know jack it might boom so you have a little flex there because i think these are these woofers are about to woof the multi button the dual button the lighting button usb type c an auxiliary port and a usb type a port and pair up wonderful water setting forest or my style in which i can go in there and configure any color setup i want [Music] the lighting is dynamic so when you have it in party mode it's actually moving along to the music i mean that kind of that kind of says it all it's almost like a it's almost like a mini dvla let's do this now i can crack them both i'm going to do the dual mode so it's actually going to give me a stereo pair out of it man that was that's easy that was that was seamless to do i can move around you see what i'm saying twice the party you could pair 100 of these 100. all right so if you guys want to pick up any of these whether it's the big ones or the more portable size all you got to do is check the link in the description you can see the x boom for yourself i think you're going to be surprised at the amount of boom the amount of bass that you can get something that you can get out of something in this form factor right here so yeah check the description,464.479,621.843,251.39800000000002
Unbox Therapy,PhL1n86OYLc,Earphone,Apple,long time coming but i know yeah yeah i mean that's it look 79 look look listen 79 79 one plus has been making a lot of noise with the new nord smartphone budget-minded smartphone but this is i mean they put this out too the oneplus buds at the event kind of at the end part of the event and so you know for me at least in the studio these went overlooked they got put to the side for a moment for obvious reasons but these in some ways well at least for some people you know it might even be as exciting or interesting the key factor with these things is the price so oneplus took a concept that's pretty well established at this point which is the fully wireless earbud and brought it down to a price that makes it a lot more approachable for people who have been avoiding the 159 to 200 price points that many of these style of headphones come with so these things look a lot like airpods they are kind of like galaxy buds they're in that same territory well they're more like airpods if we had to say between the two but the price tag is quite a bit different these are 79 and this could really help some people get into a fully wireless setup that we're avoiding it because of the cost so i have two in front of me the nord blue version as well as the white version i'm going,1.52,621.843,188.88099999999994
Unbox Therapy,PhL1n86OYLc,Earphone,Apple,to start by unboxing the blue one and then the white one i'll unbox at the end for a quick visual comparison so what does it say on the package easy to use sound quality environmental noise cancellation and 30 hours endurance with warp charge so you can use your same charger that you have for your oneplus device to charge these up i don't know what they mean by environmental noise cancellation i guess we'll find out when we try them on rated capacity for the charge box is 420 milliamp hours if that's interesting to you obviously it's it's like a lot of these other systems the case itself is going to recharge the buds now they're calling this nord blue that's because this color matches the blue version of the brand new nord which i should probably have here and i don't downstairs on the table whoo would you look at that look at that pairing right there blue and blue so this is this can be a kind of a flashy setup a youthful type of look anyways good thing we got the phone for to complete the pair all right here we go okay so there are the buds and the container is a little bit bigger than air pods probably smaller than galaxy buds and certainly pocketable of course when compared to air pods you have the convenience here at least in my case of having a type c connector on the bottom so one charger no more need for lightning and then you've also got this led indicator on the front the hinge is very air podesque,106.32,621.843,192.88000000000008
Unbox Therapy,PhL1n86OYLc,Earphone,Apple,and we have a button on the back as well crack them open all right unveil the kind of yellowish greenish combination thing going on it certainly is a style actually that carries through onto the back of the earbud as well that color color combo and we try these on do they go into pairing right away so that for me is a slightly more secure fit than an airpod it's a slightly larger ear tip it doesn't fit very deep in the ear canal it's still a casual earbud but for me that's a slightly tighter setup so that's going to be a little more convenient for any type of fitness or physical activity also inside the package you're going to find your user guide and your type c cable and they've gone ahead and given a short little type c cable to charge this up which is kind of convenient of course as i mentioned any type c cable including the one that came with your smartphone is going to be fine for this purpose as well and then a little bit of paperwork on the inside also so let's see if these things have any juice are they did they go straight into pairing they didn't tell me anything yet i'm gonna go ahead and try to pair them with my oneplus 8 pro there we go okay okay so we are now in pairing mode tap to pair what we can do one touch pair okay i didn't even have to be in the bluetooth settings at least on this oneplus device it gave me a little graphic and an indicator and then just like that we're connected,207.44,621.843,201.1970000000001
Unbox Therapy,PhL1n86OYLc,Earphone,Apple,a little added convenience for oneplus users but it's typical bluetooth stuff anybody compared to it obviously all right so let me go ahead actually and put some tunes on here real quick that's a good choice okay button touch button on the side changing songs touch area he's long time coming but i know yeah yeah i mean that's it look 79 look look listen 79 79 i don't know what's up there it's been alone a long time coming but i know you know i just realized that this somehow youtube music knows when i'm gonna do a headphone video because some somehow uh sam cook always comes up i'll tell you right now as soon as even if it's a recent mix somehow oh he paired a new he paired a new pair of headphones better hitting with the sam cook 79 i don't know what it's not gonna go up against your pro level in here like say the airpods pro or even maybe even a galaxy buzz but for a convenient for a 79 and i got to be honest with you most of the time i reach for a convenient pair of earbuds more so just because i don't necessarily want to be cut off from the whole world or mess around with the settings to put the pass through audio a lot of times i just need a convenient earbud to just have a podcast in the background and still hear my surroundings to a certain extent so i could see myself reaching for this this thing is about sort of a convenient easy entry into the full wireless future,313.759,621.843,227.08400000000003
Unbox Therapy,PhL1n86OYLc,Earphone,Apple,that many people are taking part in now you can take part in the two for 79 and you could do it in a flashy manner if you decide to go for this particular color scheme one plus buds 30 hours of sound includes the charge case on their own you're looking at seven hours for music on a fully charged pair of earphones 10 minutes of charge with your 30 watt fast charger is going to enable your earphones to be listened to for 10 hours so 10 minutes equals 10 hours equipped with a unique noise cancellation algorithm and three microphones to improve quality oneplus buds will filter out background noise for clear voice recordings and easy to hear calls the buds feature 13.4 millimeter dynamic drivers and 3d stereo through the use of dolby atmos oh instant fast pair what is that i don't even have to go to bluetooth at all hold on how does that work oh yeah so they did figure out fast pair as well which is quite convenient there's you don't have to jump all the way into bluetooth no need that's lovely very happy about that so that's the white ones now previously it was those ones just hold the thing near lift up the lid it's not quite as fast as what happens on ios but very convenient these buds also feature an ipx4 rating so they're safe from splashes and you can use them for different activities like going for a jog maybe a little sweat on them no big deal you so me,506.08,621.843,200.16
Unbox Therapy,entaNxaezRo,Earphone,Apple,Lu I want something like air pods but I don't want to spend 150 160 $200 I actually get this question asked frequently and so that's where this product comes in we just received the new Oppo and Co free and they are true wireless earbuds of course they look a lot like air pods I feel like we're in a situation now where it's a kind of ain't broke don't fix it mentality where the air pods have been so successful that it's impossible to imagine some other kind of form factor emerging this is what people want people want air pods so headphones are gonna look like air pods now I have a couple of other ear buds on the table obviously we have the classic air plug those are both air pods - these ones are just painted black this is from a previous episode where we checked out the new Galaxy buds they fit in between from a price perspective obviously around 130 bucks something like that but these new anko fries are gonna be the cheapest of the bunch on the table they're around a hundred bucks so I think that's a pretty substantial savings and if you're in the market for something like this I think it's worth paying attention to and that's why we're here what does it say for features here binaural simultaneous Bluetooth transmission okay full Wireless ultra dynamic speaker powered by a thirteen point four millimeter ultra dynamic equipped with FPC positioning system AI uplink noise cancellation during calls so noise cancellation but only during calls not during music and the coolest feature is slide and tap so all the controls for the buds are gonna be right along the earbud itself I have intuitively myself with air pods at times reached up to interact with them and then remembered oh I can't do certain functions that I would with over the ear headphones other models that I use where you can tap the side and do things turn the volume and so forth these ones do that that's pretty cool this actually comes with flexible silicone tips as well and battery life is five plus twenty hours five hours and then 20 hours inside the case okay so it's,0.0,621.843,267.62999999999994
Unbox Therapy,entaNxaezRo,Earphone,Apple,it's all fairly promising at the moment and I think $100 is a there's a pretty nice price point it's the upper end of what a person who is just sort of casually looking to improve their headphones I think a hundred bucks is kind of where some people draw the line so to get it in under a hundred I think will attract some people inside the package quick start true Wireless cool this is the case so it's a little bit bigger than air pods but I don't think that's a huge deal for most people that's still tremendously portable huge advantage for me right away which is the fact that it charges over USB type-c now I don't believe it has wireless charging maybe we'll can look into that for us I doubt it at this price point but of course the air pods did get the wireless charging and the galaxy buds have the wireless charging so if that's important to you it doesn't have wireless charging if that's important to you you probably have to look at those ones the package has a pearlescent look to it so the finish is actually different than it is on air pods this is your standard air pod finish which of course is just this glossy white this is a bit more matte so it should be maybe more resistant to micro scratches or fingerprints it's just got a pearlescent look to it there's a single button on the side Apple logo on the front and LED light it's got what you need on it open and close I mean it's all there fatter than the air pods that's one air pod height two air pods yeah I mean here's a nice advantage over air pods interchangeable tips that fit on to the ear buds so it's got a tiny little ear tip included you know this is kind of nice not just for getting the right fit but also for cleaning them these things get nasty you can pull that off clean it very easily so this is nice this is already an improvement a lot of people tell me that they can't wear air pods because they don't fit in their ears and then they have to buy some aftermarket accessory or they have to step up to the air pods Pro or purchase something like the Galaxy buds to get interchangeable tips you get that over here and this is,133.86,621.843,266.01000000000005
Unbox Therapy,entaNxaezRo,Earphone,Apple,substantially cheaper so that's definitely some points in this direction but also if you use them for physical activities if you're jumping around running around maybe we'll give them to Kirk for the test he likes to shake his head around the small is the only one with the integrated fit by the time you step up to the medium you can see it kind of lifts off the structure a little bit does not bug me and does not impact the charging they've accommodated for that extra bit right there so that's no big deal so I'm gonna put medium on both no you know I'm not I'm gonna do medium on one small on what I'm gonna actually compare the difference how about we do that instead type C to a cable to charge them up now we got to listen to them and see how they stack up now of course I've been using the Galaxy S 20 ultra so I'll be trying them out with this device though they'll work on any device that supports the Bluetooth you may have some extra integration if you use with an oppo device I'm not sure alright so first up the medium ear tip on the right ear bud okay medium feels pretty good small ear tip on the left ear bud alright so the effect here this feels more like a traditional ear pod it I can hear my surroundings there's less isolation but it also feels like it could fall out easier so it's it's halfway between it's kind of the best of both if you choose to leave the pre-installed ear tip you have a very air pod in and out experience if you want something more fitted you put the bigger ear tip on and of course that will impact your sound a little bit too the greater the seal you make the better the representation especially in the low frequencies so maybe it's kind of a good idea for me to have one of each when I go listen to some music here let's just discover and see what happens here I might say right now it's discernable to me the right left ear situation so I'm just gonna get on with it and swap out this ear tip too because the better seal is evident I'm just getting a much fuller sound on the medium ear tip it goes to show you how much of this earbud experience it is,267.3,621.843,266.098
Unbox Therapy,entaNxaezRo,Earphone,Apple,has to do with just the fit getting the right fit and how many people are walking around there with a bad fit it's a lot of people walking around in public they got a bad earbud fit and they're not even using the full potential of the bud I'm gonna go up to medium on this one as well okay yeah that's much better oh by the way I just triggered the play on there was it a tap or a swipe oh oh okay so it's a tap to pause play works perfectly how about if I swipe so swiping down goes forward and up goes back it's very fast and this is incredibly convenient that touch pad it's intuitive it's like it's what you your brain intuitively wants to do that let's show them Jack show them how quickly I swipe it goes so fast it's almost instant with my touch look I'm gonna go down here what now what happens on the left hand side if I do the same thing its fault gonna be volume oh there's different colors okay so you can get them in black they just sent us the white ones the air pod the most air pod version I would of course pick them up in black if it was up to me I know a lot of people that really wanted air pods but didn't like the price went out and bought a variety of tws earphones earbuds that were out there in a market that were kind of replicas of air pods or diff or or even if they looked a little bit different and the problem with a lot of those models is hard for me to ever truly recommend them because of the connection issues you would have one ear pairs up and then the other bud pairs to that year so with the higher-end ear buds they would both instantly connect immediately like Galaxy buds or air pods it looks like they've got similar tech in here with the simultaneous bluetooth transmission instead of pairing one earbud then to the next the earliest fully wireless earbuds I ever tested on a channel we're like that and I would have dropouts on one ear because your heads in the middle and it's trying to connect across your you know what I'm saying well and in my case a lot of density there some quick feedback on a sound I think there is a little bit of a hit what in sound quality in volume they're not sounding,407.36,621.843,313.3300000000002
Unbox Therapy,entaNxaezRo,Earphone,Apple,to me quite at the level of these other two options yeah they got a sound good it got a sound better than wired earbuds you're spending some money on them but there's way better sounding headphones for a hundred bucks if you aren't in this for convenience you can get a set plenty of sets of over ear headphones and an adapter and get way better sound so these to me are convenience products first and then the sound is it's also there but it's further down the list so I still think for this type of products in the realm of acceptability probably worth the value associated with this price point for a lot of people and the convenience of the touchpad on the side now apparently they put a lot of effort into the phone call functionality and quality as well as well as the noise cancelling during the phone call so I'm gonna do a quick test I'm gonna call will real quick I mean there's not much low end but it's pretty clear alright so I did mention earlier we did we do have to check this would Kirk's shake test because of the jumping jacks and whatnot he gets himself into on most weekdays in the mornings it's an apple juice some oatmeal and then straight into the jumping jacks so we're gonna give them a quick test it's a medium eartips I don't know what type of canals you're working with yeah it should be good there he goes okay is that as rowdy as you get though I feel like last time when you had the galaxy but you were way more rugged give give it a give it a shake I know you don't these are better oh they're better good I think we may have found a thing I can recommend to people if they don't want to spend the Apple premium or for whatever reason they're not interested in the galaxy buds obviously it's a lot like the galaxy buds this product I would I would give the galaxy buds an edge in sound but I'd give these ones an edge and convenience because of these touch pads on the side which are just really intuitive and natural to use they just make a lot of sense and then of course the price right these are a hundred bucks around a hundred bucks I think it's a it could be a win it could be a 2020 technology win the Oppo Enco free true wireless earbuds I'd probably just get them in black if it was for me,564.42,621.843,314.28999999999996
Unbox Therapy,SZD7wyfyhro,Earphone,Apple,obviously you saw the previous the recent videos on all those new Samsung devices they've been taking over the airwaves of course I'm talking about the s 20s 20 plus and well the ultra and then the flip and it's just it's it's a lot to take in it's so much to take in that there's a product here that kind of went overlooked that's the buds plus supposedly some kind of improvement over the previous version I've selected in s 20 plus to be the companion look at that look how pretty those are together I've also got the old version on the table so we can run a quick comparison so we have 11 hours of playtime triple mics for clear voice calls and Qi compatible wireless charging well that was the cool feature obviously they've been showing it off for a while since the previous version you pop them onto the back of your phone with the reverse wireless charging and the wireless charging Qi compatible on the earbuds of course there's also the AKG affiliation as you can see on the package in fact they they write it on the case as well to remind you if you're unfamiliar with AKG they've been making headphones for you know what somebody looked that up I bet you a kgs been making headphones or at least 50 years but it's probably longer it's a German company 47 think of Sennheiser in the same realm I think we can say that they're at least somewhat happy with the with the output with the final product and because they're putting their badge on it so you notice straight away that the case quite a bit different from the previous version in color look at that combination right there that's a that's a look they went from a matte style plastic to I would say this looks a little bit more premium otherwise the form factor is identical to the previous version of galaxy Bud's you open up the,0.0,621.843,238.528

Unbox Therapy,Z743oNzfIcY,Earphone,Apple,which is always the danger zone last winter season you unboxed a pair of our revolt heated gloves and I thought you might be interested in our top selling product heated insoles for the skiing and the snowboarding in the winter weather I was skiing recently imagine you throw this in the ski boot the heated insole right or if you're into the pond hockey maybe as well okay so the power switch is here and a micro USB to charge it from eight and a half to eleven and a half or I guess this is a twelve and fully charged the battery every three to six months oh wow oh you got it on the key fob and you hit the level that turns on your insoles man when you're when you're chilly you can start the car up and start cool cable that splits into two so you only need one charger and one cable to charge both insoles it's 20/20 you got to charge your shoes [Music] wait a sec oh yeah like we're gonna throw it in the boot we're gonna throw it in the boot we're gonna throw it in the boot yeah it's got the light on oh no okay yes we're heating well you're heating oh that's super close that's a tough tough job quick update it raises you up you probably should take out your pre-existing insole cuz you're elevated now it's warming it's warming now there's weight it adds weight for sure but from a comfort perspective not impacting it all that much and the warmth is kicking in now as of right now,293.3,621.843,225.44900000000007
Unbox Therapy,Z743oNzfIcY,Earphone,Apple,it's not steaming and I will say when I went skiing I thought I had a cool trick because what I did is I took the glove warmer and I just dipped that in a ski boot and I looked around I said I said huh I said huh and and then there and then everybody else had a ski place was like what they were like shut up maybe it is more of a boot thing a hiking a hiking or a boot thing who's the hiker will you're a hiker you're hiking around or you're not it's great I'm feeling heat now it's good I'm into it it's great I just know we need I would have a tough time recharging I got real serious issues with the with the recharging of the gadget we've recovered it instantly so that would be my issue oh we didn't even follow up with will yet Will's been wearing the slim phones it's only for one though what do you mean it's only for one well you can't crush the company's dreams like that they sent you that and then you say only one ear buds working I know but someone's stressing in the office right now they say it's unbox therapy man that's Willie do these are actually getting warm down though I'm cooking even though it's just a sneaker it is cooking right now so will says it's not perfect right now but the package itself deserves some attention this one is about thinness see because even air pods creates a bulge and you might not want that anyway yah yo but yo you'll be bow you'll be boats the future you just don't know it yet,412.689,621.843,213.18200000000007
Unbox Therapy,a500SZyQFxQ,Earphone,Apple,all right so this is a topic I've been looking to cover for a while now there are so many air pod type headphones that are available on the market I did a video on a product called black pods but the a was flipped I didn't think much of it I didn't realize how big the landscape of these kind of air pod looking headphones really was its extensive and of course I have a bunch of new ones that popped up in the air pods Pro format this one is called air buds Pro the same company that did the black pods that I featured and they've got their very own black version of what the air pods Pro look like these are the original black pods which by the way you have no idea really what you're buying when you buy any of these a number of people that based on that original video went out and tried to buy these ones and then ended up thinking they had received a different product and the one that I even showcased in a video on top of that there's people who paid money to certain websites and didn't get products back so just as you are watching this realized right now that this landscape is vast and bizarre you don't really know what's what and what you're gonna get for your money so keep that in mind for the record like this one is called Nikes look at that these are a bit different I've got them on the table because they just showed up as well they're called air golds first things first if you ordered some of these in the past on the base on the original video you have some kind of problem with it I just want to speak directly to this company black please try to make it right by these people just refund their money if they didn't if they can't receive the package I don't know do something and I have no affiliation with this company at all nonetheless we're gonna go over some of the newer options here before we get into it I got to give a quick shout out we have an official unbox therapy unboxing knife you've probably seen this on the channel you can actually buy it right now it is a collaboration unbox therapy and stat gear it's the pocket samurai it's a pocket knife with the unbox therapy inscription on it it's available on their website it's also available on Amazon but like I said it's limited quantities they have been doing,0.0,621.843,257.7289999999999
Unbox Therapy,a500SZyQFxQ,Earphone,Apple,this particular pocket knife for a while and then just sort of upgraded it for the box therapy version unbox your products like a professional first things first less poppy inted bees what are called the air buds Pro really has the buds air this company has the air buds we still got the dog Air Bud mm-hmm so you got to keep it all together now they include the paperwork it's very Apple ask it's almost like you bought the official thing here the packaging is very well it's Apple esque I think it's identical to be honest and this is what the cable looked like type-c connector so oh man maybe the lid is a little more loose you want to compare it oh yeah do you have the yeah where are the air pods Pro oh yeah this is the air pods Pro who can even keep it look at the box okay that's the air pods Pro so there they are those two next to each other wait wait is very similar the product from Apple it has a smoother open/close on the lid the lid has a little bit of give like like this back and forth the Apple one is a bit tighter the black grille looks more like a mesh sticker on the air buds Pro and also on the bottom it looks quite a bit different now if we compare that to the product the black pods product these two must be oh no they're no this is a matte finish on this product compared to glossy on the earlier one so the paint but the hinge is the same and the grill unit is a bit different on this one the whole thing is not a grill these ones are similar but they're also a little different and then the last pair of the pro models is these ones called na keys now the box here looks identical to the box from the first pair the air buds Pro that one looks almost exactly like the first one oh no the hinge is a bit different on the container it's kind of wild there's all these little variations and varieties than na keys probably have the best grill component it's them it's buried in there the smoothest my goodness would you look at that now also it's important to note the black pods situation there original inspiration was to create an air pod-like device that was black because apple didn't do it they did not make black available so of course when,128.52,621.843,294.211
Unbox Therapy,a500SZyQFxQ,Earphone,Apple,it comes to the pro model they're gonna have to have the black version as well and this one is the matte black style exactly the same except for the fact that is matte black the black pods models are using a traditional USB connector to lightning and the earlier ones that I unbox the earbuds Pro and the na keys are using lightning to USB type-c okay so that's another thing worth mentioning all right so the last one to add to the mix before we listen to a couple of these is the air goals which to me it's obviously the most unique of the bunch it's gonna be painted in gold by the looks of it it effectively gives you a painted gold air pod if you if you really have to show that off I don't know maybe you want to be different but I'm really curious about is the new pro models of this variety of products that exists that aren't made by Apple so let's go ahead and test a few of these all right so I have an iPhone 11 Pro max over here I also have a wireless charger here in order to check which one's Wireless charge so here are the black pods also in orange light which is tougher to see so those ones are charging wirelessly the white black pods same thing orange light comes on these are the na keys a super dim orange light comes on so they're charging and the air buds Pro yes whoo and it's also got a really dim tiny little orange light that comes on so they all appear to support wireless charging I want to be clear as well at this moment before I listen to these things I am NOT promoting or endorsing these products purchase at your own risk obviously the dream of getting an air pod like device for a hundred bucks ear pods probe device for 100 bucks that's obviously an appealing concept so do your own due diligence let's kick it off with the black pods themselves oh okay look at that it's setting up essentially the same way that the Apple branded earpods would one of the cool features of the official air pods Pro is that they have these microphones on the exterior of the device I don't think of getting any of that functionality here you're getting a product very similar to their previous product that they did but in a new format with an in-ear style let's see if,275.88,621.843,298.71999999999997
Unbox Therapy,a500SZyQFxQ,Earphone,Apple,I have audio coming through I'm getting play/pause functionality on the button if I tap it it gives me an audio whew a tick tick like I'm switching modes but I don't hear a discernible difference I mean as headphones they they sound alright though that's the problem see that's the problem with this it's people what they really want to know is can I have fully wireless headphones earbuds that are convenient to pair with my iPhone presumably am I gonna hear what I'm listening to and you are and they don't sound as good as the real deal but it's a fraction of the cost and people are cost sensitive so it's easy to understand or maybe they want black ones and it's not even an option directly from Apple you could of course go out and get them painted this is a color web product these are the official air pods - painted black but that'll cost you even more yeah they sound okay yeah I think you gotta adjust your expectations obviously to go with the price so next why don't we do this is the air buds Pro the first product that I unbox let's see what happens oh okay same thing now I have to say man this just it looks like a sticker that you peel off yeah it's definitely a sticker Jack you see that there's no microphone there alright this starts playing right away oh okay there it responded these sound way worse or way worse I think a lot of people say that's unacceptable actually that product last up here we go these are called the na keys and interestingly enough these ones have some details on the inside of the lid I don't know if Jack can see that there's text up in there a serial number and a model number Wow so those connected real smooth these are the official ones Oh oh my god I was gonna say what's going on right now I hear my surroundings and mics are on they sound good I'm like what's happening I had that these two screwed up man holy man I gotta say right now though just as a little side note since we're doing this the mics are turned on in the outside I feel so comfy right now on pause just talking to you that everything the whole thing when I put this on it all felt super quality and I was like wait a second yeah all right so on to the last one this is the,425.09,621.843,265.88000000000005
Unbox Therapy,a500SZyQFxQ,Earphone,Apple,NA keys it's like $95 you say five dollars off the black pods it's the only one where the grill on the side is not an obvious sticker I still doubt that it's an actual microphone or speaker unit in there or anything like that but you can see I flip it open right away oh look at this hold button okay and it's telling me to pinch it to go between modes but there's no way that's built into this come on anyway let's listen to these all right these ones sound pretty good not ease KP pro I need to do a quick one to knock ease versus official-official time oh man this is this is complicated switching back it's uh they sound better hold on hold on hold on hold on the base is actually accentuated on the na keys it doesn't sound better that obviously the original air pod sound better but so obviously you're not getting any of the cool features with the pass-through and a microphone no matter which one you go for that's just something you give up if you don't want to spend the 250 it doesn't really matter anything had to be apple headphones if you want that feature it's gonna cost you some money regardless of which you select but when it comes to sound probably for me the best sounding ones are the last pair that I wore there's a lot of volume there's some low-end in there it doesn't sound as full across the entire range as what the official air pods Pro do but look man if you want to take a chance do I think you should do it is complicated because these are super convenient the entire package the way this thing is put together that's what makes the air pod so successful to begin with I guess I kind of hate the fact that you're not getting the feature that I like so much in the actual air pods which is the mic pass through which you can toggle on or off and the effective noise cancelling so I would pay the extra money but if you're super cost sensitive I would say probably just skip the pro model all together and get the cheapo version of the regular air pods because those go as low as 50 bucks and you're obviously not in it for the ultimate sound quality that said if you if you're dead set on having $100 a pair of ear pods Pro equivalent probably go with the knock ease model out of the bunch that I tested here that's pretty much all I can say shop at your own risk that's that,560.49,621.843,318.818
Unbox Therapy,Jo3kgR_48qo,Earphone,Competitor,we got a new Bose product the quiet Comfort Ultra and this brings me back I've had experience with Bose products dating all the way back to that original noise cancelling stuff that really changed the industry led us to this previous model 700 series sort of departed a little bit from that Original Classic Bose design that you see in the airport and on the airplane traveler that needs to block out sound babies crying the chatter in the cafe and stuff like that now obviously have changed and Bose is staying up to date with that and including features like what they're calling spatialized audio to give you head tracking awareness that transparent mode in there as well so you can hear your surroundings if you want to it's all baked into the new quiet Comfort Ultra Ultra model is not the only model they'll be making you still have the quiet Comfort which I actually found in this cool kind of green color but in this video we'll be focusing on the new Ultra model Swept Away by sound here every Dynamic guitar RI soft spoke spoken lyrics Turn Up the Music or silence the world feature Snapdragon sound I'm very particular about headphones sound and performance and comfort and battery life Bose is saying we're looking at 24 hours of battery life or 18 hours with immersive audio press play pause the rest ooh very familiar kind of travel case here nice little hard shell carrying case and ooh kind of nice now these are lightweight I want comfort and sound and these are lighter than some of the other Flagship options that are out there,0.399,621.843,201.48
Unbox Therapy,Jo3kgR_48qo,Earphone,Competitor,cushioned headband slidy not clicky type- C here for charging it up as well as an LED in that location analog audio jack but a tiny little one I'm guessing there's probably a cable here so it looks like it's a 2.5 mil to a 3.5 mil everything just stays packed in here big labels for right and left left and you can actually see the angular design that's going to play a role alongside the immersive audio experience which they're calling spatialized give you a Sound Stage that's like somewhere at arms length it's moving that sound by knowing the location of your head simulate the experience of either sitting in front of a performance kind of out in front of you we have a dedicated Bluetooth button the other thing to mention you look around the outside and you recognize this variety of grills and that's because you have this multi microphone input and that's how noise canceling works so if we do a quick comparison between the current quiet comfort and the current quiet Comfort Ultra you can see slightly different layout sort of old school switch on this one same 2.5 mil this one's got like a clicky headband where this is a little bit more smooth weightwise they're fairly comparable actually before I set that up I want to mention another feature because Bose has a variety of audio products they offer including sound bars you can actually link this and sync this with an existing Soundbar so when you're on your couch you can have your own personal volume level sure sure so it sees the QC Ultra headphones let's connect ready to connect I'm going to actually throw,100.92,621.843,173.16099999999997
Unbox Therapy,Jo3kgR_48qo,Earphone,Competitor,these on now by default I have some noise cancelling on immediately you can name your QC Ultra headphones what about Dark Star or Fargo jet there we go that'll do ah so we have a demo for their immersive audio sure let's experience the demo in the off setting you're just having your typical stereo left right then there's a still setting so it's kind of right out here somewhere still stereo still left right channel but out in front of you it will track your head's location so if I turn my body this way the audio is still here and then the last setting is called motion the audio follows you in your head location if I turn this way it's still still out here sort of somewhere at Arms Reach but it's adapting and maintaining that positioning I'll leave it in the still setting for now so they're going to power up just by opening the headphones from the flat position and they can go to sleep in the same fashion so you don't need to actually hit a button if you don't use them for 24 hours they'll power off completely so this little button here is going to control play pause that's above the power switch so this same button that you're using for most things is also going to control your noise cancellation mode so if I press and hold that I'm now in Awareness mode and woo I can hear myself now pumped through these microphones and feeling as though I'm not even wearing headphones crystal clear as if there's not headphones on my head wow I'm going to press and hold it,188.44,621.843,181.16000000000003
Unbox Therapy,Jo3kgR_48qo,Earphone,Competitor,again I am into immersion mode now and then quiet which is the most extreme noise cancelling that man is gone yeah you're gone dude wow oh set get started you see we've got 50% battery life you also have an equalizer built in so if you do want to kind of dial in your sound maybe you want to see a base boost or if you just want to reach in there and do your own kind of custom that's available use your shortcut to resume Spotify oh that's cool and let's go listen to some stuff you want some classic L later there we go controlling the audio with the meter is kind of nice oh the immersion mode on spoken word dialogue like a podcast is very strange go ahead try and say something he's dead nothing Zer all very powerful noise cancelling as soon as you have an audio Source it just goes it gets boosted up even more so as I'm sure you're aware like some classical music we back to [Music] immersion [Music] I kind of like the immersion like in the still mode it's kind of cool it sound like I have it playing on a record or something over there you can go in and actually create your own mode so I can just say like commute Focus Home music outdoor and then the parameters that are available in there is the amount of noise cancellation which you can really dial in it's really amazing how far these things have come I remember in the early days being like this level of noise cancellation is too much obviously we saw the development of transparent modes which do the complete opposite but,285.36,621.843,204.58799999999997
Unbox Therapy,Jo3kgR_48qo,Earphone,Competitor,to be able to go in there and really dial it in in these incremental levels kind of nice there's also a wind block mode that you can apply to a specific setting Merion setting which can be off still or motion and that's for each mode now maybe I should listen to something with a little bit more base some I'm listening to popular music I clicked on listen now I'm listening to popular music Taylor's version I can't hear you man you're saying things I can't hear you a lot a lot of lowend available if you want it listen what are these headphones about this is about utility like I look at this headphone particularly if you buy it in Black like this and that it can executive it can be some sort of famous athlete it can be uh a world traveler just tremendous noise cancellation really strong transparency mode and now immersive setting I personally like how low-key the design is like minimalist almost like it's the the the classic form of headphone the lightweight aspect is also key for me because if I'm going to wear any headphone or choose to put in my bag chances are a comfort is going to play play a big role so that's the new new quiet Comfort Ultra and if you're wondering about the product line for the new models is quiet Comfort Ultra and then quiet Comfort if you guys are interested in learning more information or picking up a pair I'll head down to the description we'll have all the details down there Bose 2023 quiet Comfort [Music] Ultra,397.56,621.843,203.11999999999998
Unbox Therapy,Ke6-hZ16s-0,Earphone,Competitor,oh now I am really happy that Samsung continues to push forward the foldable because we are desperate for these new looks and new takes if you spend any amount of time in like like this experience of having all this real estate oh that's because this is one of the one of the true under display situations wow oh what's called cream it does actually look kind of appetizing almost so I like the modern look to it on the back modern shapes we got all the new stuff yes exciting day it is the Z flip three five G and a z-fold three five G it is not just these retail units in front of me my goodness I got everything it's all the colors it's like look at this a greenish tone and the lavender thing that got Kirk quite excited even with the big one as far as the big one's concerned like we got this color what is this it's uh some type of silver Phantom silver cause Willie dues on Deck just right over there behind the laptop he just finished eating a sandwich which means that he's fired right up and then we have this one right here which is uh apparently some type of green it's almost black I like those deep greens what's this one called Phantom green just stick with the Phantom you'll be all set it doesn't stop there we also have the watches Galaxy watch 4 classic and Galaxy watch for the Galaxy buds 2 the S Pen Pro and and then the S Pen over here which fits into the case now this was rumored and look it happened S Pen input on Z fold three this is what a lot of people wanted and it is official so why don't we kick it off with the z-fold three 5G every so often there's one that comes across that it'll get you going because it's kind of the reason you got into the business to be excited by new things new gadgets new ways of looking at something and that's where the fold lives for me because the very first generation came out this one right over here and immediately I knew something was up something was different now we're on the third generation they continue to make improvements to it ipx8 you have Gorilla Glass victus on here the pen input now snapdragon Triple Eight is going to be in there 12 gigs of RAM is going to be in there Flagship status inside this box is going to be Phantom black and right away you know it's not your typical smartphone it's already and it's folded out State and this is a huge display to work with 7.6 inches on the inside and then of course that exterior display 6.2 inches a slight increase in PPI as well that's where you're going to get your Gorilla Glass uh victus hmm now I am really happy that Samsung continues to push forward the foldable because we are desperate for these new looks and new takes so it's a very deep black and you can see it contrasted against the display over here now the camera layout changed a little bit sort of fits in with the rest of the lineup so you have 12 megapixels across the board here and then you have some optical zoom in there as well at 2x let's go ahead and just do our initial fold here so still so very satisfying here you can see the black hinge as well the device got lighter you know it's a relatively large device that's the point of it right it's meant to fold out and be kind of a productivity monster if you need to launch for example a desktop version of a browser no problem 7.6 inches but it meant that when you were using it as a regular phone it was kind of heavy but they were able to trim that back 271 grams on the new model 279 grams so we're shaving grams and that's tough to do from an engineering standpoint that's going to be a little bit of paperwork also a Sim tool is in there a type c cable to get it charged up the days of power bricks are over this is your Phantom black this one is the green and when you set them side by side now you can start to appreciate how green this is or how black this other one is I'm probably partial to Black still but as far as greens go that's a nice little subtle one Phantom silver over here so this is your lighter variant which has a little bit of color shift to it so that just gives you an idea of the differences there so you're going to get 12 gigs of RAM no matter which version you get you're either going to get 256 gigs of storage or 512 you're gonna get a 4 400 milliamp hour battery it's now starting at 17.99 in the US and 2269 dollars in Canada yes it is still a premium price tag but it is obviously a premium phone it's got the premium spec sheet and it happens to be one of the very few foldable devices to choose from so the price tag kind of fits here it's truly doing two things and getting a a little tablet and a smartphone in one this is the case that houses the pen and this just inserts like this it's like a wallet style case and it allows you to store your pen so that's what the form factor looks like if you want to go this route I'm more inclined towards keeping the case uh slim uh we're also of course going to have a later case that we're going to put out for that device we have the version here for the z-fold two this is about as thin as it can possibly get we're also going to have it available right now while you're watching this to pre-order for the z-fold three so go check that out let's move on to the Z flip three the Z flip in general is not something that I spent a tremendous amount of time with but it is an exciting form factor this one actually caught Kirk's attention he's like I don't know maybe I should be uh flipping I know famously My Pal Austin Evans loves this particular device this is the portability Advantage this thing when it's folded down is Tiny in the pocket,0.96,621.843,719.161
Unbox Therapy,Ke6-hZ16s-0,Earphone,Competitor,and I can tell right away it's lighter weight when you have it in the traditional foam form factor it kind of feels like a regular smartphone that just so happens to fold all right so what is this color called will oh it's called cream it does actually look kind of appetizing almost so I like the modern look to it on the back modern shapes when you hold it like this like I said it really feels like a typical foam maybe even lighter than some other non-folding devices with a similar form factor this is super comfy to hold up take a phone call and then just quickly you quickly fold it down I gotta improve my fold game oh there we go that's starting to starting to come back to me now there's something so satisfying about physically folding and then when you go for the pocket test on this it's tiny in the pocket you hardly notice it's there compared to some of these monster smartphones we're carrying so when it comes to portability that's a true advantage to the flip over the fold now when you're unfolded obviously you have a little bit less room to work with well quite a bit and that's where this device comes in that's why my preference is the larger one a huge OLED display to watch content on that's where this one shines but on the go this one here is going to be tough to beat 6.7 inches obviously the aspect ratio is a little bit different so this one is taller which helps make it comfortable to hold so as far as the processor goes we're still looking at top tier specification Snapdragon Triple Eight whether you go flip or if you go fold this is cream we also have a greenish color it's kind of more of an emerald what are they calling this well just green straight up green keep it simple and easy for myself and then we have another lavender like color this one is quite flowery and vibrant obviously we have some differences here triple camera setup on the fold double camera setup on the flip so we have 12 megapixels times two so on this one we're lacking the optical zoom but the whole thing is so slender it kind of makes sense as far as unlocking the device it's similar on both you place your thumb in this location over here you have volume up above that so to unlock it it's a very sort of natural spot and it's also the button that you're going to use to power the device inside the package here it's going to be identical yeah we've got our USB type c Cable in there as well if you head to samsung.com you're going to see the entire selection of color availability so the Z flip 3 is going to start at 999 dollars so it's going to be a little bit more budget friendly as well and in Canadian dollars you're looking at 12.59 to start so you've got eight gigs of RAM here you're either going to get 128 gigs of storage or 256 gigs of storage I almost forgot about this yes front-facing cameras so on the fold you have the exterior front-facing camera but then you also have the interior front-facing camera with the sort of hole punch setup right there and then on the Z flip same idea we have this tiny little hole punch right over here this is 10 megapixels on both the devices so the cover camera on the exterior of the fold is going to be 10 megapixels then the under display camera on the inside of the z-fold 3 that's going to be four megapixels oh that's because this is one of the one of the true under display situations wow it kind of hides the front-facing camera ever so slightly so it's a little bit you know less offensive than having a hole punch that's pretty wild so I got both the devices booted up set up now and this is what they're gonna look like in their uh folded down flipped down kind of uh form factor you can see man this thing is almost like half the size when it's folded down and then what's funny is when you I don't know how funny it is but when you unfold this they're almost the same form factor on the exterior but then this one has the next level to it obviously you go like this and this is the thing that I've missed I can't wait to get back to and get the SIM card back in because this is just it's a lot of fun I mean you just boot up some YouTube or something if you spend any amount of time in like like this experience of having all this real estate and let me just show you what I'm talking about with the audio listen to this this kind of viewing experience right here on the OLED [Music] I mean it really feels like you've got a tablet a tablet that can also go in your pocket and also be a phone if you need it to and it's really it's truly unique in that sense look at this I mean I know I realize you can do multitasking under the phones but you just don't have the form factor to truly take advantage of it if I flip back fold back into this orientation then I have comments so I can be watching up top looking at comments down below when it comes to content consumption this thing truly comes into its own oh I see how they're doing it so the camera area is still the location where you're keeping you know your clock and your battery life and things like this so tabs will open up underneath that portion but if I go this way that's where the front-facing camera no longer becomes a significant obstruction previously you would have had a a giant hole punch there but now with this new tech instead it just looks like sort of a little tiny grid pattern but I think over time you're basically you're going to stop even noticing that and it's going to be less of a distraction than the hole punch would be so it's cool to see this technology implemented especially in a device like this which is so centered on content consumption and immersion as far as fancy tricks go on this one if I did the,370.62,621.843,693.6389999999999
Unbox Therapy,Ke6-hZ16s-0,Earphone,Competitor,same task open up YouTube it's obviously a much different experience here because if I go scroll I mean I can still have a video and scroll here that's super tall the video portion itself is quite small but if I it also depends on the aspect ratio of the video keep that in consideration the this show is 16x9 look at the expression right there what a pause that's quite a pause look at the expression so the best part here is you get big smartphone experience but you can do this you can just bam and have a tiny smartphone in your pocket big smartphone experience tiny smartphone in the pocket this is small tablet experience and regular size smartphone in the pocket the last time that I use this device as the daily driver I noticed I ended up using this display a lot when I was out and then when I had a little bit like a moment to relax or something or I needed to get more comprehensive stuff done then I'm going to this display here and it was a huge improvement over the first generation when they went with the bigger exterior display which truly made it function like a typical smartphone with a typical screen size without the need to unfold it okay now another thing that struck me pretty much right away especially when comparing this model to the previous generation is how much work Samsung has done on the hinge mechanism so obviously uh a big component the most important component on a folding device is this hinge that makes it all possible and of course we've seen the exploded views and ask them how many individual pieces and a variety of mechanical aspects how much of that goes into this hinge section but I noticed right away when opening and closing this thing it is absolutely A Step Above what was happening on the previous model this one now can stop at any point so it's a little bit less flimsy and feels more robust through its entirety of opening and closing it reminds me of one of these car doors that you would have on like a luxury vehicle that can stop at any point as opposed to continuing to swing to only like two or three points along the way and I'm wondering if this new construction has anything to do with this enhanced IP rating as well that they've been able to put into this device and then also like where does that play into the overall weight of the device because somehow they were able to create a more satisfying and solid feeling hinge but then they were also able to drop the weight ever so slightly so that's kind of a nice combination it just feels to me like you're dealing with a device that is not first generation anymore you're dealing with a device here where they have learned from the previous models and taken what they've learned and then applied it and that's the nice thing about new form factors there's so much room to grow and to figure things out as you have success along the way and I do expect Samsung to continue to have success with this model because now you've also got the pen input to go with it which is something that a lot of people wanted and could be a compelling characteristic like a compelling feature for them to step up to it now as far as that front-facing camera this image here is kind of probably the best illustration you can get as to how it hides when you're looking at it straight on but then it's kind of still there if you're really looking for it the video over emphasizes the existence of it but I would say at first glance here it is Improvement and less distracting than the hole punch equivalent now some of those hinge characteristics apply to the flip model as well which you're looking at right here and of course this also has this secondary external display for some basic information but you can see just how solid this hinge design is across the entire range of motion now this device I never spent a lot of time with the previous model maybe that will change with this model because there is something satisfying about this form factor as well and especially when it comes to single-handed usage it feels really light in my hand even more so than devices that don't fold at all it has this kind of Slender feeling to it and because it's mostly tall and narrow one-handed text input is super easy to do so if you're one of these people that's always on the go this could be the foldable for you uh I don't know for me it's just such a tough choice because I I'm compelled by by that large screen the ability to have a tablet in your pocket when you need to get even more stuff done but these do have their set of similarities when it comes to the way that you unlock them the big thumb print on the side and of course the vibrant OLED that's the other benefit here in order to get foldable you you're working with OLED to begin with and Samsung has figured that out a long time ago they have some of the most pleasing screens and as you've seen from this imagery here these things pop absolutely tons of color lots of contrast those deep blacks and so on and so that's another appealing component whether it's a foldable or not a foldable [Music] foreign [Music] but just look how portable this thing is once it's folded up in clamshell mode appealing for somebody who is going out wants to throw it in their purse or in their pocket it's uh it's really there's not a lot on the market that's quite like it as far as the camera options go you still have a lot of camera versatility it might not be quite to the same extent as something like the S21 Ultra but it's almost there so you can see some of the zoom capabilities here at the 2x of course you're going to have your portrait modes built into there well it's the Samsung camera app so whatever,721.079,621.843,700.0679999999999
Unbox Therapy,Ke6-hZ16s-0,Earphone,Competitor,you're used to seeing you're going to find it here as well including uh this fine moment sentimental moment between Kirk and Kovu yes it's capable of capturing such things [Music] there's also going to be a night mode built in there this is a super early preliminary test but you're gonna find it to be comparable with the rest of the Galaxy lineup so two very cool devices but not the only stuff that Samsung has announced launched today we also have the new watches as well and I have the retail packaging here so let's go ahead and do the unboxing Galaxy watch 4 classic Galaxy watch 4. this classic is in Black so this is a 46 millimeter stainless steel case you can see the sensors in the back military standard 810 G GPS 5 ATM and Gorilla Glass DX 20 millimeter band on it this has a rugged kind of military look to it and on my wrist I you know I like this sizing might as well take advantage get the bigger display on there plus you feel like you have something substantial that you're wearing they do make it in different sizes in fact I have one with a silver white layout over here if you want a smaller size but the classic looks still oh how satisfying very satisfying I might get stuck doing that anyway yeah so if you want the classic look but with a smaller scale you can do that to 42 millimeters the watch 4 is a slightly different style to it compared to the classic so this one is going to be lighter weight this is the 40 millimeter and then over here with the White Band I have the 44 and 40. the silver model you can see here you have the black front large display ratio and then the silver bars on the side that kind of looks cool am I crazy yes so this is what your charger is going to look like the USB type A on one side and then um a magnetic connector I presume let me just peel this off very simple and Sleek no pins nothing like that it just Clips right on very nice the watch band has this quick release style over here as far as the buttons go you have a red indicator on the top button they're tactile so they have a nice springy click to them of a video we got going on here on this classic model with the White Band we have a leather band the classic Model here that I was saying was sort of military styling this one has like a rubberized band similar but slightly different from the watch 4 over here this is also rubberized and so is this a white model right here might be partial to this one but just if I had the black band on it the watch four I'm sure I can get that in Black yes we have green and pink gold as well I don't have those ones here but yeah you have the difference between aluminum construction on the regular model and then the classic Model this is stainless steel so that's why it feels uh more robust if you if you kind of like that weighty sort of quality feel to it features an exynos w920 chip 1.5 gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of internal storage oh baby here are the sensors packed in accelerometer barometer gyro sensor geomagnetic sensor light sensor Samsung bioactive sensor Optical heart rate sensor electrical heart sensor also known as an ECG and bioelectrical impedance analysis Bia these are full out Health devices these days 2021. yeah the crown is your input method actually well on this model you simply move between your screens with this tactile click it's quite satisfying if you haven't tried it before now of course you can also just touch the screen because it's a touch screen so if you don't have this bezel like on these other models then that's how you're going to interact with it you're right it has like a digital wow and almost does it make a noise very slight noise so this one has a haptic version of the physical click I probably partial to the physical click myself but if you felt like you were missing out you're not you're gonna get the digital equivalent on the non-classic model so many options to choose from which is great especially in the watch category where everybody wants to personalize what they've got and use it in different ways at this moment if I had to pick between these four I'd probably go for this classic Model the larger classic Model myself this is just far too satisfying using this alright so I want to talk a little bit more about the S Pen real quick so I have this z-fold pro model here now it is a different pen for these the fold right this it says right on it fold Edition now I presume that has something to do with the nub oh they've definitely reformulated the nub I'm just looking at it right now that is your full version of the nub it's the same on this uh Z fold the pro model as it is on just to fold Edition this is the smaller of the two that fits into the case this is if you're getting real serious and there's a little switch a physical switch it's also just physically bigger or what oh cool look how you charge it up on the ends little cap and type c charger this one doesn't need to charge very cool all right so a couple of different options for you there now let's actually try out the input so if I open this up let's see what goes on here oh it's oh that's it it's just working straight away I can just oh man oh wow that's a whole new that's a whole new opportunity here makes a lot of sense in your brain like it just makes sense at this range to be scrolling like this I think the S Pen has actually come into its own on this device right here the bigger the display the more obvious the,1083.179,621.843,760.3220000000001
Unbox Therapy,Ke6-hZ16s-0,Earphone,Competitor,pen input becomes you have this like two-handed thing you can kind of go up to the top portion of the pen and in a relaxing fashion just scroll through documents uh you can mark them up obviously it's just an extra a level of Versatility there so that's a nice addition both are capable of Air Command however the pro model is capable of air actions listen listen oh so satisfying I actually thought it was the pen on the screen no no no no no no no no it's the speaker but it's very satisfying so kind of like how an electric car will have a some sort of sound feedback to help you realize you're doing something this is the equivalent of such things wow last up item the Galaxy buds 2 clear enriched sound with two-way speakers active noise canceling comfortable fit and 5 to 20 hours of play time there we go very nice the container in glossy white LED light on the front USB type c on the back to charge it up and USB cable included in the package so we crack it open this model has this like dark gray on the inside you can see the shape probably have interchangeable ear tips too I'm guessing inside the package look at that so you can pick the right size that's suitable for you there's your type c cable to charge it up now I mentioned I have different colors so this is this graphite Sound by AKG so that partnership is still in place and then I have some more over here now you might be deceived because you say that they all look the same yeah the cases are the same but then you get a sense for the color when you crack them open this must be Olive come on will did I get that one all right that's Olive graphite we have white the most obvious of the bunch and then lavender lavender wow wow okay which one are you guys going for here this is a tougher Choice a little style aspect we got two Olive selectors yeah Moe and Kirk you guys are merging into the same person you've been spending too much time together I'm gonna be boring and take graphite and I'll save the lavender for Willie do um although it's like that's a move there's a move going on right here you're Gerald undone 149 U.S and 189 Canadian active noise cancellation transparency mode 5 to 20 hours of battery life you do this charging orange light that never gets old that's always convenient oh there we go galaxy but sure you connect look how tiny those are little Pebble shape no stem necessary I hear the noise canceling kick on straight away and a gaming mode minimize audio delay for vivid synchronized gain gaming sound so that's gonna be like a low latency mode very cool you guys make noise like say something check check check check check check check one two three check one two three I'm trying to do like that lip reading challenge right I hear nothing all right not bad wow what what an unboxing Extravaganza shout out to Samsung for uh for coming through it's the buds it's the watches it's the new folding stuff I haven't been as pumped to throw my SIM card into a new phone in a while I've already been telling Willie doing that new phone shows up it's about to happen I love stuff that's different I've been doing this job for a little while just just a couple of years something like that a lot of smartphones that come through here it's another slab and another slab and then they show up with some folding stuff and all of a sudden I'm like all right maybe that science fiction future maybe we're maybe there's more to the story maybe we're going somewhere I don't know maybe I can still be surprised and that's always a fun experience you know a little bit of magic it's not old on me yet I'll tell you that right now I know when the first version came I was like whoa wow it's really folding exciting times it doesn't have to be another slab the imagination is alive and Technology you can do something different you can flip you can fold it's up to you it's cool let me put the SIM card in actually before I do that let me show you I got a giant box of accessories so you can even make whatever you want out of this thing holy look at this flip case with some style and you can hook it on to something of course we got the silicone covers we got a cover with like a keychain style ring on it maybe you want to have this uh so many to choose from oh here's the leather flip cover this seems to have like a little handle on it oh and there's a magnet that pops it in right there when it's not in use that's an executive look ready for the meeting or right for anything actually I'm ready for you to cut where you make some deals I show up I'm like I'm ready to make a deal I brought my leather today let me just do the crazy case that Kirk was showing off check this look out this look here is no joke how about this for a look holy cow turning heads that is a style aspect to it they actually make that same case with with neon green and of course if you want a later case as well for the z-fold three we're doing it already available for pre-order right now so go check that out if you want the thinnest thing possible of course we also have it for the z-fold 2 previous version if you want to check that out so man what a time to be alive folding smartphones it's real they're here to stay we're on the third version way to go Samsung,1480.32,621.843,719.8620000000004
Unbox Therapy,NiWqsZesm_E,Earphone,Competitor,so I made that video recently about the Apple earpods they came back into my life I've been using the air pods and kind of enjoying it they're wildly successful you see them out in the world other manufacturers you know they're entering the space this is the latest incarnation of the fully wireless Samsung earbud product has a couple of features that haven't been seen before prime my favorite one is the fact that this entire setup can charge from any phone that supports wireless charge sharing because this is a Samsung product and this is a Samsung phone there's also some interplay there that's a bit smoother than it might otherwise be with a third-party pair of earbuds or puds but once you're into the app this is where I think they have a bit of an advantage over the air pods they're super configurable here we can see the battery life of each individual units you can use one independently of the other you can keep one of these guys charging in the case while listening to the other one there's some different equalizer settings here for a bass boost soft dynamic clear and so on you can manage how these things deal with notifications they do have touch pads on the side unlike the air pods these have interchangeable ear tips and ear hooks as well look at all those options the air pod you've seen it before doesn't fit that far into the ear canal for some people this fits really well others it won't stay in their ears these on the other hand are gonna be a bit more predictable because they sit further in,0.03,621.843,183.23900000000003
Unbox Therapy,NiWqsZesm_E,Earphone,Competitor,the ear canal and they have that secondary rubber plasticky component they should just be a bit more secure in there considering the way that they're designed air pod is a bit taller but also slightly less chunky than the Galaxy bud so people want to know hey which one should I get considering that you can use either on multiple platforms they do work as Bluetooth headsets you can use the air pods on Android you could use the Galaxy buds on iOS within the app there's also a find my earbuds button so that'll track these down these things could be pretty easy to lose I mean they are tiny also there's a pretty cool ambient sound option I can actually elevate the volume of ambient sound a sound around me so it'll be amplified into my ear so I can hear my surroundings while I'm listening to music podcast audiobook and so on now you can toggle that all the way down so that it's muted you know what's going on around me is muted you have ambient if you're on the bike you're cycling you need to hear if if a car honks its horn or something this can really amplify your surroundings of course it's not on the air pods there's also a voice focus feature in there so this looks for voices specifically and allows them to cut through that particular frequency range I find this to be useful from time to time now the way that the touchpad works you can tap to play or pause a track double tap to play the next track answer or end a phone call triple tap to play the previous track and touch and hold to use a user configurable users,92.31,621.843,179.36000000000004
Unbox Therapy,NiWqsZesm_E,Earphone,Competitor,choice you could have that launched something specifically do something specifically and that's user configurable that's nice now that I have it for quick ambient sound I'm gonna touch and hold and see if I can lighten up the surroundings here we go oh wow that's cool it toggles ambient mode while you're holding your finger on the touch pad I'm in ambient right now I can totally hear my conversation hear my own voice now do I look a little strange doing this quite possibly but the question you all have is like how do they stack up against the air pods now as you guys know I'm an s10 user this is the device that's currently in my pocket so the effectiveness of either of these earbuds it has to be in correlation to this particular device we talked about some advantages within the app who knows I might be willing to give up those extra features in exchange for potentially better sound I'm not really sure we'll start with the galaxy buds I want to make sure I've got maximum volume okay so now I know I've got max volume a little sample mm-hmm okay now we're in soft right now dynamic clear bass hmm [Music] okay I'm wondering right now if the people that have tested these already had them in full volume or not cuz I read some of those things that you read and that was the experience I was having until I made sure the buds themselves were max volume and the phone was max volume now there's a lot more thump way more bass our people doing it wrong [Music] it's a headphone I'm hearing instruments,181.66,621.843,197.249
Unbox Therapy,NiWqsZesm_E,Earphone,Competitor,I was gone for a minute did you trick sort of I've heard better kind of feel like I got to do this exact same track right now on the air pods like right now without further ado hurry up hurry up hurry up way less isolation I hear the the fan on the camera here we go beginning you know neither are blowing my brains out you know obviously I've tried some very expensive headphones in this spot in this seat right here we've done it together you and I Jack Kirk and whoever else happens to be behind me on any given day these are tiny dental floss situations look at them in terms of sound I think I can say based on that quick little test right there the buds there's a bit more thump to it maybe my expectations were too high either probably closer to this performance then they are to like a full-on pair of headphone performance that said the most striking difference for me between the two is the fit and the feel right in the sound seal when you put these on you feel isolated but there's a drawback to that I noticed they're in my ears a little bit more this I don't even feel it this is a kind of a tighter feel if I had to choose this is a bit more comfortable for my particular ear canal and that's part of the reason I think I keep reaching for the air pods in the first place not because they sound the best but because you just don't even notice you're wearing them that could be a good thing or a bad thing neither are going to be an amazing audio experience but really these products are about convenience so evaluating them on convenience you have to give certain,289.77,621.843,178.26
Unbox Therapy,NiWqsZesm_E,Earphone,Competitor,points to the new Samsung product because of the fact that it can charge wirelessly and off of the phone itself also the app gives you more configurability also another thing worth noting the galaxy buds are a bit cheaper than the air pods though that's not much of a surprise that is a hard pick I really don't know I mean it might be so simple as if you're on on samsung or on Android you might go for these and if you're on iOS you'll probably go for these just for the easier pairing across devices oh it's a hard decision I'd say if I'm about to do some kind of physical activity if I'm going for a jog or something I don't jog but like let's say I did I will probably reach for these ones it's just a bit more confidence in the fit but if it's just if it's in an environment like around the house I she really liked the idea of not feeling the thing in your ear as stupid as that looks you forget that it's there I already have so many great sounding headphones if I want to get down to business with music I think I'll probably still reach for these more because of that factor and then also keep by Sony headphones the dedicated over ear headphones with the noise cancellation everything else keep those for the discerning listening but if I didn't have those other headphones and I needed something that could isolate better than the air pods and I can only have one pair I only had 130 bucks for one pair I probably go for these it's only a one pair of headphones I probably would choose these over these but in conjunction with a really nice pair that you use sometimes this is the I don't even notice I'm wearing them headset that's the bottom line [Music],378.96,621.843,185.43900000000002
Unbox Therapy,lGkrhR2mfl8,Earphone,Competitor,so i've been meaning to try these out the google pixel bud sort of google's answer to the apple airpods it has its own charge case but there's still a cable involved this cable goes around the back of your neck it would have been nice to see a fully wireless design comes into different colors to match the phone this is the just black version my understanding is this is gonna work really well with the pixel device we gotta try it out there's the little case that's small that's portable type c connector over here pretty straightforward boom [Music] there's two contact points on each of the two earbuds for the right and the left adjust the amount of slack kind of cool so it fits in this area here and then you close it do you unlock your phone and turn on bluetooth bluetooth is already on open the case next to your phone with the buds still inside right within the os shows a picture of the earbuds yes i'd like to connect now it's,0.08,621.843,112.72000000000001
Unbox Therapy,lGkrhR2mfl8,Earphone,Competitor,explaining the fit to me this way so meet your google assistant here your messages calendar events and other important info all i do is touch and hold the right earbud hey google what can you do she said you can say things like play music or what's the weather what's the weather nine degrees celsius partly cloudy nailed it did the raptors win their last game no the raptors lost 122-119 yesterday versus the wizards that's nice the real killer feature here beyond your notifications and google assistant is also google translate for obvious reasons hi my name is louis i am your friend okay let's bring in our special guest okay everybody round of applause barry our helpful mandarin speaker today you must have used an app like this before you but you would just hold it up to the other person oh yeah and then pass it back say something in mandarin back to me hello how are you today i just heard that in the pixel button right so i could say back to you hi there i'm doing very well,56.16,621.843,130.32
Unbox Therapy,lGkrhR2mfl8,Earphone,Competitor,and thank you very much for helping me out with this video right here it's pretty good i mean there's couple missing words a little bit but i understand the whole content this is convenient right here because the other person doesn't need to have anything i could just pass my phone here and i would have the headset and you and i back and forth what do you think not bad pretty good now what would happen if we both had pixel buds what would happen if we both had pixel buds i didn't translate the pistol cuz you're not happy right now not really you're not happy right now okay let's get more complicated then it's preposterous how intricate making an unboxed therapy video is for our extravagant audience [Music] you're gonna kind of adjust a little bit slow it down a little bit if you are a pixel owner they integrate really nicely there's nothing better than google translate i mean it's got so many languages in it i realized i didn't listen to music on these i think they probably sound a little bit,123.6,621.843,143.22100000000003
Unbox Therapy,lGkrhR2mfl8,Earphone,Competitor,better than airpods you can't really put them on par with like some dedicated over-ear headphones or something they're not really there but i was recently in india although most people speak english there but in the event that they didn't i could have been i could have done i coulda [Music] understand more that's right so i gave this a little bit more thought it's an expensive pair of earbuds a lot of promise with the whole translation aspect it all sounds very good there's actually a lot of drawbacks to this you don't have a fully wireless design i don't particularly find them to be the most comfortable earbuds either they don't fit in my ears that great they don't block the surrounding sound at all so don't expect some kind of isolation here also this this big compelling feature with the translation it's cool but really you're just using google translate for now it's not quite real time,215.599,621.843,114.40100000000001
Unbox Therapy,lGkrhR2mfl8,Earphone,Competitor,the only difference is one person's audio is being heard privately i can't help but feel at this point that this product here is sort of like a 1.0 and there's a lot of room to grow there it doesn't seem like a legitimate airpod competitor as it stands right now as of right now given the price given the 1.0 status of this product i can't recommend it to you i'm gonna say do not buy the pixel buds wait for the next version they gotta get better happy chinese new year get out of here no chance how do we shorten it just be like um [Music] oh that was perfect i can't get julie [Music] julie did i nail it yeah that was perfect yeah he said perfect juni juni xin yen you happy do you want to say anything to the world hey mom he died see you gotta say hi to somebody all right it's not easy all right give him a thumb thank you very much thanks man thanks appreciate it [Music],272.56,621.843,145.138
Unbox Therapy,kQX6R5H_yGQ,Earphone,Competitor,so I just asked you guys on Instagram if you wanted to see an airport unboxing video courtesy of one of these Best Buy Express vending machines obviously there's a lot of stuff to selecting here for this unboxing video I read your guys comments and a lot of you wanted to see my opinion on these right here since I play around with and listen to so many different headphones it is kind of strange that I haven't tried anything from Bose yet so you order right down over here let's see headphones and you can see the different options we have the overpriced QuietComfort 15 right there what are they selling for 329 bucks all for the purpose of your entertainment ok by now I assume they're going to need my credit card number pretty soon I'm about to be robbed if I Best Buy and Bose credit card is inserted and swiped goes up grabs the headphones but waits for my verification very interesting okay so it's grabbing the headphones now sliding them down just like purchasing a can of,0.03,621.843,159.63900000000004
Unbox Therapy,kQX6R5H_yGQ,Earphone,Competitor,soda here we go hello where are you imagine this thing screws up and you got a $300 set of headphones on the other side I don't think shaking this is going to work Wow check that out that's pretty cool all right so just like that QC 15s are in my hands now let's go to in Airport unboxing video so my flight San Francisco is about to take off in fact they're boarding right now so we're going to do this on boxing video then we're going to have to speed it up it's going to be a speed unboxing but the cool part is if I get this done in the airport then it means I can edit the video on the airplane and actually test these things out on the flight and it's five hours so it would give me a good chance to get to know these headphones which I've never tried okay I'm going to find a table we're going to do this thing guerilla style no studio necessary in here this is going to work,77.05,621.843,145.523
Unbox Therapy,kQX6R5H_yGQ,Earphone,Competitor,yes this work so I found a spot to sit down let's go ahead and take a closer look at the box so I've taken off the plastic so that I can maintain my sanity here while trying to unbox this with one hand as you know there's nothing simple about that this is ghetto style right now okay so here are the QC 15s they give a protective case I knew that that's why I wasn't too concerned living the box up we've also got a tiny bit of paperwork right here silica pouch keep it dry dry is good when it comes to electronics inside the case is of course where the headphones live you've probably seen these on somebody they're incredibly popular I can't really say too much about Bose I know of course this is your run-of-the-mill type of headphone brand and you're probably not getting the best bang for your buck here but I do kind of owe it to you guys to try something a little bit different out after all they are so popular and you guys probably have lots of questions about how these sound comparatives to,155.47,621.843,122.94000000000003
Unbox Therapy,kQX6R5H_yGQ,Earphone,Competitor,some of the other stuff that I featured on the channel so anyways actually not a bad design pretty soft as well on the inside and really light that could be a good thing or a bad thing it could mean that they're cheaply made or it could just mean that they're going to be really easy to keep on your head and not get fatigued this metallic ring around the outside the ear cups do flip they fold flat for portability obviously they take batteries that's what powers up that active noise cancellation I believe and there's a power switch in that location there it looks like a pretty well padded headband as well and then a huge array of cabling so oh they've also included a battery that's awesome I don't need to find one so it takes it looks like a single triple-a battery to me there's an airline adapter for using your headphones on airplanes which is what they expect and a couple of different cabling options one of them obviously has that inline microphone I,217.72,621.843,126.35
Unbox Therapy,kQX6R5H_yGQ,Earphone,Competitor,have a flight to catch what am I looking at here 402 it started boarding five minutes ago it was a major sacrifice but I wanted to do an exclusive in the airport unboxing video people think I'm crazy sitting around me you guys asked for it on Instagram and guess what you got it QC 15 unboxed impromptu unboxing video leave a thumbs up down below leave a comment and I'll see you guys in San Francisco later so it looks like the flight is delayed a little bit or at least they're not boarding yet so I figured I might as well show you guys what these look like on my head in the meantime if I can get them on with one hand let's see one-handed operation is it possible oh I think so so there we go they're actually really quite comfortable obviously no active noise cancellation happening right now I haven't even put the battery in but lightweight and comfy I will get on this flight soon and that's what I'm eating these things plugged in and set up and like I said before seen in San Francisco 55 that would be passengers to Fogg Louie looper though,280.64,621.843,154.05800000000002

CNET,crLx7vBhUDY,Earphone,Apple,[Music] the second J airpods Pro just got a brand new update with iOS 17 the airpods pro have two brand new features an Adaptive listening mode and a conversational awareness that quiets your music when you want to speak to someone if those features sound somewhat familiar it's probably because they've been present in most of Sony's wf1000 line most recently the wf1000x mark 5 so I'm going to test out these buds to see if there's any noticeable difference in their approach to these features let's go so to know if your airpods are on the latest firmware you just need to go to settings go into Bluetooth and look for your airpods and tap on the I icon from there you should be able to see the version number which should say 6A 301 if they don't you can try and speed up the update by connecting your airpods to your iPhone or iPad just give it 10 or 15 minutes and they should be updated as an aside these are the older lightning airpods Pro 2 too the updated versions have USB type-c and lossless audio you just need the extortionately expensive Apple Vision Pro to make them work but I digress let's get on with it both conversational awareness and speak to chat allow users to speak to someone without having to physically take their,0.17,621.843,153.14999999999998
CNET,crLx7vBhUDY,Earphone,Apple,buds out or lower the volume however their approach couldn't be more different in typical Apple fashion conversational awarness consists of a toggle in the airport T and that's it after that you just have to start speaking and your music will gently taper off into the background and transparency mode will kick in so you can hear whoever you're talking to once you stop talking the music will fade back up in around 5 seconds with the XM 5S you get a whole lot more control with the accompanying Sony headphone app with the app you don't just get to toggle the feature you also get the option to set the sensitivity from high to low to automatic and how long before the music restarts once you're done talking so you do get a little bit more control with the xm5 once once you start talking you hear a chime and your music pauses and won't restart until your set time but what about sensitivity like what does it take for these modes to trigger let's find out so right now I'm whispering to see if this is enough to trigger conversation awareness mode and as you can see the decibels are still high so Whispering works so I'm whispering now to see if it'll work with speeder chat and as you can see the music is going so spring,77.2,621.843,149.88
CNET,crLx7vBhUDY,Earphone,Apple,[Music] works so humming seems to uh trigger conversational awareness mode for those Hummers out there m music pours straight away so humming just like the airpods triggers the speak to [Music] chat so apparently clearing your throat seems to trigger the speak to chat who knew so yeah it seems like the airpods do just that little bit better differentiating from clearing your throat to actual spoken words which the Sony seems to stumble over a little bit but overall when it comes to both features if you prefer to pick up where you left off the XM FS are for you if you like a more seamless transition in and out of your music then you want to go for the airpods moving on to each Bud's adaptive mode they are meant to take the guessing game of when you need to engage transparency or noise cancelling the Spiel is the more you use them the more they adapt to your habits once again with apple you just toggle a switch from the control sensor and forget about it this makes it a little harder to know if it's actually working or not for the most part it feels like you're just in a slightly less,158.15,621.843,148.409
CNET,crLx7vBhUDY,Earphone,Apple,transparent transparency mode but it's not until you start adding loud noises around your environment that you know that it's really working so right now I have adaptive mode on and you know I can hear some of my uh surroundings when I snap I can hear my snap very clearly but as soon as I put on the vacuum let that go on for a little while suddenly it cuts off a little bit in my ears and now that snap is nearly inaudible I can barely hear it if at all so yeah adaptive mode works like a Dr with the xm5 you get far more granular control once you have adaptive mode on you can select from a number of states in which to have more or less transparency by default when you're stationary or in a commute noise cancelling is fully on whereas when you are on the Move walking or running transparency mode is on but you do get to choose how much of the world you want to let in so if you're on a run for example you might want more transparency than if you were on a leisurely stroll there is this notable chime every single time the states change in the adaptiveness which can definitely take you out of your music however you do have the options and settings to disable that tone to make things flow a little,253.439,621.843,160.48100000000002
CNET,crLx7vBhUDY,Earphone,Apple,better after spending a little time with both Birds it's clear to see that they've taken totally different approaches everything Apple does is made for complete convenience that does somewhat stifle control on the user side but the implementation is so smooth and seamless that you might actually forgive the lack of autonomy the XM 5s on the other hand give you all the control for those who know what they're doing they'll love to tailor every part of their listening experience one thing I could do without is the constant Chimes you get when the buds listening States change but like I said earlier you can turn that off in the settings at the end of the day if you're someone who just wants to plug play and forget then I think the airpods are a great shout cuz they do this so well but for a deeper control you can't go wrong with the XM 5S they give you just enough options to make it worth it without being overwhelming well that's all from me but what do you think of these buds do you think their features were implemented well like let us know down in the comments and don't forget to hit the link in the description to find out more information about these buds thanks again so much for watching and I'll catch you on the next one,333.8,621.843,132.43800000000005

CNET,IwXHOeJ5khk,Earphone,Apple,the airpods are getting an upgrade Apple unveiled some new airpods features at WWDC 2023 including an adaptive audio mode that mixes active noise canceling with transparency mode Let's dig into how that feature and the others are supposed to work IRL active noise canceling is meant for times when you want to block out the sounds around you like say during a loud plane ride transparency mode is meant for times when you want to let some of that noise from your environment seep in like for example during a walk outside when you're not trying to miss important,0.24,621.843,59.881

CNET,8db1Wijj3ws,Earphone,Apple,congratulations Apple you really did it the circle of life is complete air pods are becoming iPods or at least that's what we are seeing in various mock-ups posted online inspired by an apple patent application that puts a screen on the airpods charging case for controlling music and other things last year we mourned the death of the iPod product line after 20 years when Apple discontinued the last iPod Touch model so what is dead just may live again okay don't hold your breath over a patent but this is a great time to go over what we are expecting for the next batch of airpods how we can see something cheaper in the airpod lineup and even some new buds may be coming out for the Beats brand and we are gonna go over more of those patent details on what this potential airpod case could do because it no it goes at Goldsboro then Apple just dusting off the Nanos from storage and slapping them on airpods cases as we go over all of this there is one more thing I want you to think about when it comes to the evolution of the airpod or really the evolution of all of our accessories at what point do accessories just hold more smarts and the phone becomes a hub managing it all then again maybe putting a screen on something is no different than giving Malibu Stacy a new hat gotta give you something new to buy I'm Bridget Carey and this is one more thing [Music] patents are fun little nerdy Clues to how a company is thinking about the future and this patent application has a lot of Clues Apple filed it in September of 2022 but it was published recently by the U.S patent and trademark office and let's of course give credit to the site,0.439,621.843,213.759
CNET,8db1Wijj3ws,Earphone,Apple,patently Apple for putting the spotlight on it this document indicates a few things that apple is considering for the next stage of accessories the case that charges the airpods would have a screen to let you see information and control audio it'll have play pause skip that sort of thing but it also would convey information to the user with haptics essentially it turns the airpods into a remote control that you can keep in your pocket it also would have voice commands with Siri or it says you could do a touch gesture kind of mimicking the rotation of the wheel control of an iPod you would swirl your thumb in a circle to change the volume also you could swipe to change a song the patent goes through the ways of handing off a song that's play on the iPhone have it switched to being played on the airpods and also handing off something to the homepod speaker one useful trick highlighted would be that you could watch a video on your television but then have the audio transferred to the headphones so you can watch without disturbing others if you want to keep the room quiet or it would be cool to do something like that on an airplane there is also a mention of squeezing the case to switch different types of audio modes and you can see notifications of incoming messages or the weather pretty much like what you would see on an Apple Watch alert so why do any of this if you already use an Apple Watch it's a good question that Apple will need to answer I think of it as just another option for control and it would be important to have the Apple watch also be connected to all of whatever this is having hiccups where controls are on one screen but not the other is going to be an,107.579,621.843,188.46200000000007
CNET,8db1Wijj3ws,Earphone,Apple,annoying user experience and this all gets down to the concept of making your gadgets feel like an extension of you small swipes just make the music play the way you want it to play without taking out a phone or fumbling to see if the song is being controlled on your watch or phone or your case that means the screen that is easiest is the one that needs to be available to work and it means that the iPhone isn't the end all be all screen for everything it could be treated more like a central Hub to process all the information from the different accessories on your body Apple isn't the only one thinking in this matter take for example the JBL tour Pro 2 these are earbuds with an LED display in the case JBL is owned by Samsung and these were shown off at the recent CES the 1.45 inch LED touch display manages music it receives calls and gives social media notifications it's priced at 250 bucks and it's listed as coming soon there's also the poly Voyager 360 Series this has a touch screen charge case and it costs 230 dollars but patents don't always mean it's officially a product it could be another year or more before we see something like this from Apple what consumers may find more pleasant to the ear is news that Apple could be focused on making a cheaper version of wireless earbuds back in January Tech analyst Jeff Pugh said Apple will likely come out with lower priced airpods in 2024 he referred to them as airpods light analyst mingshi kuo also made a similar prediction saying that we should get a cheaper airpod product in the second half of 2024 maybe at a price point of get this 99 but to be clear the idea is that this is supposed to be a new,202.08,621.843,208.14
CNET,8db1Wijj3ws,Earphone,Apple,product not just a discounted older model maybe something that's like a stripped down version of airpods Pro without noise canceling which honestly I would be down for I'm not a noise canceling fan it kind of has a weird feeling to me when I try them out the cheapest model of airpods right now though are the 129 dollar second gen airpods it makes you wonder if Apple would just lower those to 99 and still come out with a new light model the hard thing to predict here is that airpods have been sold as a premium product and would Apple really give us a 99 version of something new or would just drive us deal Hunters to an older product either way there are more clues that new airpods could be really happening nine to five Mac found a developer version of iOS 16.4 with code that referenced unreleased versions of airpods so something could be up and 9 to 5 Mac also found references of iOS 16.4 supporting the yet to be announced Beats Studio buds plus the regular Beats Studio buds were released in 2021 now the buds plus are said to have active noise cancellation and transparency mode and support audio sharing automatic device switching and the ability to say Hey Siri just like other Beats wireless earbuds that use apple chips like my Powerbeats Pro this is what I use we don't know when Studio buds plus will be announced but the current ones are priced at 149 dollars so maybe we are getting new Beats headphones soon but does that mean no new airpods in 2023 it's hard to say there is no regular schedule of when airpods products get released some have entered the spring sometimes it's the,305.94,621.843,218.52000000000004
CNET,8db1Wijj3ws,Earphone,Apple,fall we have seen some sort of new airpods product every year since 2019 the airpods max came out in 2020 the third gen airpods were in 2021 airpods Pro in 2022 so are the airpods max due for an updated version maybe but analyst Ming Chi Kwo is thinking that's not gonna be for another year however if you want your airpods to feel like new there was a firmware update just released this week There's no notes from Apple and what the firmware includes the update is for the second and third generation airpods the airpods pro and the airpods max these firmware updates just kind of happen automatically it installs over the air when the airpods are connected via Bluetooth to an apple device and a fun fact Apple says that if you do not have an iPhone or iPad or Mac computer because maybe you are an Android owner that uses airpods then you're gonna need to go to an Apple store to get the update installed well that is an earful from me what do you want to see in the next generation of airpods let me know and you know what it's gonna soon be Earth Day are there any sustainability issues you want Apple to address this year give it a thank and tell me in the comments you may get a shout out in the next video last week we got some comments from you about air pods we heard from Andrew ellick who says regarding future airpods they've always had a fatal flaw collecting earwax the pictures I've seen online will never be unseen purely out of fear I stick to Beats wireless earbuds the speaker grills and sensor sealed making them easier to clean thank you Andrew for also getting that image in all of our heads y'all need to clean your ears I'll catch you next time don't be gross,415.02,621.843,221.78100000000006

CNET,Xy8yJcVjQGk,Earphone,Apple,[Music] after spending two months with the airpods Pro 2 I'm really surprised at how much I like these wireless earbuds from the improvements to sound quality over the originals to longer lasting battery life and an even better fit than before it all adds up to a great all-round experience now they're not perfect but I think for many people they're going to come pretty darn close in this video we're going to explore what they like to use every day and I'll share some tips and tricks that I found to get the most out of these wireless earbuds so whether you've also been using them for the same amount of time as me or you've been wanting to find out more about how they hold up long term well let's Dive In for my fellow small ear Brigade the airpods Pro 2 fit so much better than the first generation okay so the physical design hasn't really changed but the difference is there's now an extra small ear tip size which quite frankly has been a game changer for me in terms of getting these to fit really well finally they stay in my ears even when I'm working out without needing to reposition them constantly and push them in throughout the day so on the first generation airpods Pro I would always need to use third-party foam tips now don't get me wrong these are absolutely great and Incredibly functional so I could always get a really secure fit but it is an extra cost on top of the earbuds themselves and of course there is a little bit more effort required to sort of pinch and insert those memory foam tips rather than just popping them in with the default silicon tips and sometimes depending on the size and design of the tips they do need a little bit more adjusting to get them to sit in the charging case properly now I got my wish for extra small ear tips but I just hope that there is an option for Apple to add an extra large ear tip size as I know that there are many people on the other end of the ear canal Spectrum who also need a different fit from those,0.0,621.843,232.92000000000004
CNET,Xy8yJcVjQGk,Earphone,Apple,included four sizes now if you're on the fence about upgrading from the original airpods Pro and you also have small ears well you don't necessarily have to spend big just to get that better fit because the good news is I found those extra small second generation tips actually fit on the first generation airpods Pro and they cost eight dollars from Apple directly for two sets many airpods users myself included have been asking for volume controls on the stem and Apple has delivered with the second generation but I do find the precise finger placement is key and for me it's taken a little bit more time to get used to this than I would have liked look maybe it's a fat fingers issue but even after two months I still don't get it right all the time and I accidentally end up going through the stem itself rather than where you should be swiping on which is the force sensor so I do actually find it a little bit easier to make kind of a rest for the bottom of the stem with my thumb and then swipe with my index finger up and down and this really helps so I'm not accidentally dislodging it from my ear as I'm trying to find that sweet spot again I'd expect everyone's experience with this is going to be slightly different depending on how they fit in the ear I'm really glad that the stem controls are now present but more often than not over the past few months I've definitely found myself still in the habit of adjusting the volume on my phone or if I'm wearing wearing an Apple Watch with the digital crown and also it's the little things that I really appreciate how these no longer have that kind of high-pitched squeal noise that you might have experienced on The Originals when you have noise canceling on and you accidentally cover the grill with your hand or in some cases it would happen with my longer hair or for those of you who like to sleep with earbuds on I know there are some of you out there it could sometimes happen when you rest your head against the pillow so my eardrums thank you for alleviating that,115.2,621.843,224.34100000000007
CNET,Xy8yJcVjQGk,Earphone,Apple,on the newer version Apple thank you no earbud video is complete without talking about the sound and of course this is very subjective but for me the airpods Pro 2 have really filled in the picture compared to the first generation now if you're coming to them for the first time without having dipped into the Apple earbud system before they are definitely the best sounding and the most rounded of all the options that you can choose from right now including for me the airpods of third generation so for my ears the sound profile definitely has more emphasis on the bass than any other Apple earbud that I've tested but it is balanced in such a way so I don't feel like I need to constantly crank the volume to also hear that definition in the mids and The Trebles like I do on some other wireless earbuds still I am craving a user adjustable equalizer from the settings app rather than relying on the Adaptive equalizer all the time as great as it is even when I'm switching between musical genres I just like extra customization the active noise canceling also gets a boost that I wasn't expecting to make as much difference as it actually does my colleague David carnoy's review which is great and I highly recommend you give it a watch right up here goes into detail about how the ANC is improved across the range of frequencies and he does a great job of explaining this even further but to cut a long story short in all the situations that I've used the noise cancellation so even when I'm trying to mute out the sounds of the waves at the beach when I'm on a phone call it's been noticeably improved over the first generation adaptive transparency Mode still continues to surprise me and two months in I still get kind of a bit of a shock when it does kick in sometimes now this helps to lower the volume of external sounds that are above an 85 decibel threshold and for me I found it most helpful on walks that's usually when I rely on transparency mode to keep an ear out for my surroundings but say a loud rumbling truck goes past and then,227.4,621.843,244.55900000000003
CNET,Xy8yJcVjQGk,Earphone,Apple,density is muted a lot more than it would be if I didn't have this mode on but I do feel the effect could be a little bit more subtle or gradual sometimes when it does kick in I feel it goes from Full ambient transparency mode and then feeling like somehow I've suddenly turned on active noise cancellation when I wasn't looking and live listen it's still my favorite secret spying tool no just just kidding I would never use my earbuds for nefarious purposes so if you're not familiar with live listen it's basically letting you use your iPhone as a microphone to pick up audio while you're wearing the airpods and echoing them to your ears now this is not new on the airpods Pro 2 but I'm still actually surprised at how many people don't know this exists so definitely try it out and it is great for accessibility now on a more serious note the other accessibility options on the airpods Pro 2 are really thorough whether that's adjusting the click stem speed or adjusting how exactly that transparency mode works to having things like background sounds and I unexpectedly really love background sounds again not new to the airpods Pro 2 but sometimes I do leave these in my ears even when I'm not on a call or listening to music and then through the accessibility menu you can toggle on soothing background sounds like the ocean or something like rain battery life is better than the original airpods Pro in terms of overall listening time I'm generally averaging between five and a half to six hours with moderate volume using transparency mode Now using active noise cancellation does drop that a little bit further but I do find actually anecdotally I feel like I am charging the case itself a little bit more than I did with the originals so what's next well I really hope that there's going to be some sort of high resolution audio playback support in the future yes obviously Bluetooth does have its limitations but maybe there's something extra that can be unlocked in,349.919,621.843,243.23899999999998
CNET,Xy8yJcVjQGk,Earphone,Apple,a future update especially given that Apple music now supports lossless audio Apple's done something similar before with the first generation airpods Pro if you do remember back in 2020 they suddenly got this spatial audio feature when the software support unlocked the capabilities of the built-in gyroscope and accelerometer a year after they were originally launched so I'm still holding out hope true multi-point connectivity is still one of those features that I do miss the most when I come from some other wireless earbuds and while Apple's quick switching between devices signed into the same Apple ID does offer some relief and it does work really well it doesn't quite go all the way for me in my particular use case if I'm switching say between my work MacBook and an iPhone well obviously like I'm not going to sign into my personal Apple ID on my work computer because you know like maybe that's a niche really Niche example but I'm sure you could also be in the same situation as me now having true multi-point here would be a really nice option to be able to connect two devices at the same time without manually needing to toggle on or just rely that it's going to pick up when I'm switching between them now the other part of the equation that's left out is how these actually fare with an Android phone now I haven't spent enough time with them on Android as I usually tend to gravitate to another set of earbuds like the Sony xm4s when I am using an Android phone but I'm always interested to hear of your experience and if you are interested in a breakout video about airpods and Android let me know I will get testing So In Sum the airpods Pro 2 not perfect but they have almost everything I wanted in the original airpods Pro and I really enjoy using these earbuds but what have they been like for you I'm curious to know how they're holding up and what your experience has been like as always the comments are open and you can find me on your favorite social media platform like subscribe and all that jazz I'll see you later [Music],471.419,621.843,242.74

CNET,4yxmNxd88SQ,Earphone,Competitor,back in 2022 Sony's wh1000x Mark 5's got CET editor's Choice Award and have been up there with some of the best premium consumer headphones that's cute but with Bose releasing the quiet Comfort Ultras is a time to put the XM 5S out to [Music] pasture when it comes to these headphones there is a clear winner more on that later but first let's see how these headphones stack up against each other in a bunch of user critical categories looking at design and both of these headphones have definitely gone down different paths the XM 5S are lightweight and the blend of synthetic leather and plastic while the QC Ultras are equally lightweight but use real leather along with aluminium and plastic the aluminium Yol is cold to the touch and offers a premium feel just be sure not to pinch your fingers on that hinge the XM 5S while not as premium feeling have a more rugged nature to them they are built real sturdy and offer more Flex in the QC Ultra when it comes to padding it feels like the QC Ultra is firmer but also tighter around your ears while the xm5 leave a little bit more room in the short term I think the xm5 softer cups are more comfortable but the QC Ultra is firmer pads will probably stand the test of time a little better when it comes to the headbands there's definitely less padding on the xm5 the cylindrical headband offers less surface area on your head compared to the QC Ultra which covers your head a little bit more and has extra squishiness in the padding which I think will help with longer listening sessions overall the wearing experience for me is pretty comparable when it comes to comfort but if pushed I'll probably have to side with the XM FS just for that softer padding and how the housing doesn't clamp on my ears nearly as much as the quiet Comfort Ultras but your mileage may vary take my wife for example wife yes don't do that okay listen I've given you both of these headphones to try on yes which do you find more comfortable absolutely the bow,0.76,621.843,252.83900000000003
CNET,4yxmNxd88SQ,Earphone,Competitor,why is that they seem to have a smaller headband part so that when they go on my head they don't slide really far down so they're like really comfortable and exactly where I want them to be mhm and why why are't these so comfortable well these must just have like a longer headband and don't go as tight like around this section so that when I put them on they sit so low on my head and they're putting all this pressure on my jaw that after like not even one song I'm starting to notice and it just feels like when you clench your jaw wow yeah so uh yeah I guess head size is a real factor for Comfort my melon found the xm5 is extremely comfortable whereas my M minuscule Cranium beg to differ another key difference between the two is how they fold away the xm5 has a single hinge with a swivel rocker to allow the headphones to fold flat while the QC Ultra dual hinge allows you to fold flat and up making them a little more portable and nothing demonstrates this point more than the respected carry case the xm5 case is so big you will be hard pressed to fear inside a laptop bag which isn't the case pun intended with the QC Ultra the fact that the entire footprint of the QC Ultra case fits within the xm5 case should say it all really so the portability points definitely go to the QC Ultra now moving on to the most subjective part of this comparison sound quality and yes you'll be happy to know that both these headphones offer premium sound which should be a given considering their premium price attack the xm5 sound is very accurate very warm you get a lot of detail and Clarity from those 14 mm drivers the QC ultr sound in my opinion is a little better than the xm5 they have the same drivers as their predecessor headphone 700 but its new corcom chipset does a lot of the heavy lifting to improve on that bow signature sound it UPS the detail and Clarity with slightly more defined bass and I do love me some bass both of these headphones have a companion app where you can adjust EQ settings so if there's a particular type of sound you like you'll,127.799,621.843,245.76000000000002
CNET,4yxmNxd88SQ,Earphone,Competitor,more than likely be able to recreate it with either for a base test I used dead preses hipop and cranked both eqs base to the max the XM 5S handled it well for the most part but near the end at the climatic lowend revb section I did notice that the headphones distorted a bit I had no such problems with QC Ultra the prolonged Reverb was handled brilliantly with the base staying tight and accurate with a satisfying lowend Rumble in terms of controls both use a mixture of touch gestures and physical buttons the X and Fs lean more on touch controls although it does have a couple of buttons for power pairing and mode switching Bo's playback controls are more traditional with a single press to play pause your music double press to skip track triple press to skip back a track and the volume being handled by a touch strip on the right cup meanwhile the XM 5S double tap the right cup to pause and play swipe forward to skip forward swipe back to skip back and swipe up and down to control the volume on the surface the xm5 control seem more intuitive but because it's different from the traditional style the QC Ultra uses I did find myself actually using the wrong gestures from time to time when I first got started using the xm5 after a while though I did find them easier to use them the bows because I didn't have to hunt around for that physical button when it comes to audio codex the XM 5S get more options with Sony's own highdef L deex support along with appex which are both used for certain Android devices iOS users will have to make do with the more generic AAC codec Bose also offers appex but with a bunch of Android phone makers not renewing that Apex license it's going to be hit or miss to know if your phone will actually support high definition music but you can always get high fidelity through the included a cable for both headphones But Here Lies my biggest bud bear with both of these headphones neither of these headphones allow for USB audio despite having a USB port and even worse for the QC Ultra they need to be powered on to be used wired while the XM 5S can be used,251.079,621.843,254.399
CNET,4yxmNxd88SQ,Earphone,Competitor,passively I just feel like this is an oversight considering the money Bose and Sony are asking for especially when the Beat Studio Pro offered this feature for $50 to $80 less onto noise cancelling and both the QC Ultra and the XM 5S are absolute class leaders so to give you a demo of both headphones noise cancelling and transparency mode I'm going to mic them both up and listen to something on my TV and hopefully the the quality will come through let's give it a go appreciate the Ingenuity it takes to develop new technologies but with Wess charging it seems like it's two step [Music] forward Tak to develop new technologies but with while it's charging it seems like it's two step forward the major feature for Bose this time round is immersive audio which essentially is the spatial audio feature found on the airpods max it takes your music from inside your head and opens it up and feels like it's more around you the still mode keeps the music in front of you panning your music from ear to ear when you turn your head while the motion mode tracks your head movements to keep you in the center of your music Sony's answer to this is 360 audio which works in the same way however it only allows you to use a feature with a select number of streaming services which is a little bit disappointing especially for Apple music and Spotify users as those Services aren't one of them both headphones allow you to adjust the level of noise cancelling or transparency by creating in sound profiles but the way these features are implemented are mes apart with the xm5 you can create profiles for different states and locations much like the QC Ultra but Sony's method is a little more automated changing profiles depending on what you're doing once you've set it up the QC ultra's profiles need to be changed manually and if you create a bunch it could end up being a bit tedious cycling between all these profiles by long pressing the media button it could be cool if a double long press would be able to cycle backwards,378.039,621.843,243.16
CNET,4yxmNxd88SQ,Earphone,Competitor,so if you had two Prof as as you liked you could just cycle back and forth between the two and of course you'll be happy to know that both of these headphones have multi-point bluetooth pairing and at these price points they had better I found the transition from my phone to my tablet smooth and seamless on both with minimal delay just a quick word on core quality and both of these headphones do an excellent job cancelling out that background noise and callers will have no problems hearing you over any noisy traffic if I had to nitpick I might say the xm5 sound a little more processed and the QC Ultras more natural but decide for yourself by listening to Cena OG de Caro test calls I'm standing here in the streets of New York with uh a lot of cars going by um I'm talking to another Dave on the other line having a conversation right now what do you think Dave uh can is my voice clear and how much background noise are you hearing a test call here with fellow CET editor John Falone John I'm New York City uh a lot of traffic going on behind me so I'm just going to talk a little bit longer to have you hear my voice with the uh the background noise let me know what you think as I said at the top of the video when it comes to these headphones there is a clear winner here and that is the consumer yes I know it's a bit of a cop out but I truly believe that you can't go wrong with either headphone it's more about which one fits you better both produce class leading noise cancelling both offer excellent sound quality and core performance and both are Mighty expensive however I would say headphones like this are an investment I have owned the original qc35 from 2016 and aside from replacing the air cups and headband they have stood the test of time if you take care of these headphones there's no reason they won't last the best part of a decade and Beyond making the cost a lot easier to stall but what camp are you in are you a QC Ultra or you an xm5 or maybe a totally different pair of headphones Al together put it in the comments and don't forget to check the link in the description to find out more information on both headphones thanks again so much for watching and I'll catch you on the next one,507.84,621.843,260.11899999999997

CNET,6r7EjDZVFi8,Earphone,Competitor,these headphones is totally new it's sort of a cross between Bo's previous Flagship model the noise cancelling headphone 700 and the quiet Comfort 45s another upgrade is their dual hinge,11.32,621.843,22.959999999999997

CNET,wjRaEc3QTIA,Earphone,Competitor,[Music] hey folks I've got Bo's new flagship noise cancelling headphones here the quiet Comfort Ultra headphones they cost $429 that's a lot to pay for headphones and not surprisingly they're very good but are they better than Sony's wf1000x Mark 5 Apple's airpods Max and some other headphones in this price range let's get right into the review so I can try to answer that for you [Music] [Music] so as you can see the design of these headphones is totally new it's sort of a cross between Bose's previous Flagship model the noise cancelling headphone 700 and the quiet Comfort 45s which have morphed into a new $350 model that Bose has simply named The Quiet Comfort headphones the headphone 700 had some metal Parts but the QC Ultra headphones incorporate an aluminum yolk and arms that slide into the headband another upgrade is their dual hinge design so they both fold up and fold flat just be careful not to get your finger caught in the hinge which I did a couple of times and got an unpleasant pinch the headphones feel durable and are surprisingly lightweight at 254 G which is just a couple of gram more than what the headphone 700 weigh the Sony XM 5S weigh 249 G while the much heavier airpods Max tip the scales at 385 G Bose reps told me the QC Ultras are designed to fit a wider range of head types and like other Bose headphones they're quite comfortable to wear they did clamp slightly more than the Sony's but I was able to wear them for a couple of hours straight without a problem like other ovar headphones they will steam up your ears if you wear them around in warmer environments it's also worth mentioning that the Black version of the headphones can end up showing some smudges if you have any Grime on your hands or just have oily skin the white smoke version doesn't I did like the controls the QC Ultra headphones feature a mix of physical control buttons along with a,0.83,621.843,235.08
CNET,wjRaEc3QTIA,Earphone,Competitor,raised volume strip on the right ear cup that's easy to reach and use by feel alone there's also a touch and hold gesture for that strip that's customizable as a shortcut you can choose to map it to one of four functions the main button on the headphones allows you to pause and play your audio with a single tap skip tracks forward with a double tap and Skip back with a triple tap holding the button down lets you toggle through full noise cancelling an awareness mode and immersion mode that activates full noise cancelling along with Bo's new spatial audio feature with head tracking that it calls immersive audio the awareness mode is equivalent to Apple's transparency mode and it sounds quite natural with almost no audible hiss there's also a new active sense feature that kicks in some noise cancelling should the sound get too loud around you that's similar to the new adaptive audio feature on the airpods Pro 2 that feat feature isn't available for the airpods max because it requires Apple's H2 chip thanks to ear detection sensors inside the ear cups when you take the headphones off your ears your audio will pause and resume playback when you put them back on beyond that if you set your headphones down somewhere and forget to turn them off they'll go into a sleep mode to conserve battery life if they aren't used within a certain amount of time you can actually set the time anywhere from 5 minutes to 24 hours they will completely turn off on their own that's similar to the airpod Max's power saving features while Bose mentions that both this overear Ultra model and its new QC Ultra earbuds feature world class noise cancellation and they certainly do the real feature it's hyping this go around is immersive audio its custom version of a spatial audio Bose says that immersive audio goes beyond special effects and creates a wider more spacious Sound Stage so your content becomes multi-dimensional and layered regardless of the audio platform or device like other headphones,130.28,621.843,212.51999999999995
CNET,wjRaEc3QTIA,Earphone,Competitor,that feature spatial audio Apple's latest airpods for instance since the QC Ultra headphones and QC Ultra earbuds have two spatial audio modes one still mode without head tracking engaged and a motion mode that uses headtracking and allows the audio to move with you so it's always in front of you Bose says it works with movies and any stereo track but it's really designed for music listening using the immersive audio feature does widen the Sound Stage a bit creating the illusion that your audio is more outside your head it works better with some tracks than others but it does open up the sound a bit giving it area quality most people will probably choose to leave it on but the downside is that engaging it does impact battery life significantly the headphones are rated for up to 24 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels with noise cancelling on but that number dips to 18 hours with immersive audio engaged I spent some time comparing the sound quality of the QC Ultra headphones to that of the Sony wh1000x Mark 5 and the airpods max while the QC Ultra headphones have the same drivers as the headphone 700 the ultra sound has improved it's not a huge Improvement but the ultra seems slightly cleaner sounding and more revealing with deeper but well-defined base since they feature the same drivers most of the audio quality gains come from the more powerful chipset with improved digital processing both the Sony xm5 and airpods Max are excellent sounding headphones and sound quality is subjective as everybody has different ears and different musical tastes but I'd say this Bose is a touch ahead of both the Sony and airpods Max for sound quality the Sony has a slightly warmer sound profile and the Bose just comes across as slightly more natural sounding than the airpods max by that I mean it sounds slightly more accurate all that said I was slightly disappointed that headphones don't feature USBC audio you get a headphone cable for wir listening which will come in handy for air travel,236.68,621.843,219.31899999999996

CNET,xx53IGT1j3g,Earphone,Competitor,[Music] hey there so Bose has introduced three new headphones two over ear models and one set of in-ear earbuds I just got back from the launch event and I have some early impressions for starters you should know that these are kind of expensive headphones the new quiet Comfort Ultra headphones cost 429 dollars the quiet Comfort Ultra earbuds are 2.99 and the new quiet Comfort headphones are 349 dollars I'm going to give you a quick rundown of all the new models just be aware that this is not a full review I only got to listen to The Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones for a very short period of time but I will have full reviews in the coming weeks so I'm gonna start with a new flagship over ear model the quiet Comfort Ultra headphones it's the most different of all three that have been announced it truly has a new design it's a successor to Bose's noise canceling headphone 700 that came out in 2019 it has the same drivers but it has a whole,0.32,621.843,131.111
CNET,xx53IGT1j3g,Earphone,Competitor,new chassis it's got some aluminum in it it's the first set of Bose headphones that has an aluminum yoke and also arms that go into the headband that are also aluminum so it does have a sturdier feel than past those headphones but it does weigh around the same as those headphone 700 but around 350 grams and it really was comfortable to wear as you'd expect from a set of Bose headphones but the feature that Bose is really highlighting with these headphones is something it calls immersive audio it's a spatial audio mode it's Bose's version of spatial audio and these do have head tracking so you can use this both in still mode with a fixed sound around you as well as a motion mode that has the head tracking engaged and so the sound stays fixed in right in front of you and as you move your head the sound moves with you I don't know if it's better than Apple spatial audio or Dolby spatial audio for that matter but it does widen the Sound Station it does get the sound out of your head Bose wasn't,68.58,621.843,125.99999999999999
CNET,xx53IGT1j3g,Earphone,Competitor,really promoting it for use with video so much but it can be used with video there are both said 10 microphones on these headphones for external on each ear cup as well as one internal microphone in each ear cup those are both used for voice calling and noise canceling the voice calling is apparently on the same level as the headphone 700 I was a fan of the headphone 700 I really didn't like their sound and these also feature clean well-balanced sound with good detail Punchy bass I do think you'll get slightly better sound from these but it's largely due to the better digital processing It Isn't So Much due to the hardware because again they have the same drivers as the 700s but from what I heard from about seven or eight songs I listened to from an Apple playlist if they really have a nice clean sound at least for my early listening sessions I do think these compare favorably to headphones in this price class these are obviously expensive at 429 dollars you,131.34,621.843,131.999
CNET,xx53IGT1j3g,Earphone,Competitor,have the airpods max it's a little bit more but I do think these measure up pretty well against the airpods max all right I'm going to move on to the quiet Comfort Ultra earbuds these look almost identical to the quiet Comfort earbuds too that were released just last year and it was a bit of a surprise that Bose has now released an update already it usually takes a lot longer to release updates to its headphone line they do have a metallic finish on their front that isn't there with the the QC earbuds too but basically they're the same there's one other small difference the stabilizer fins the the ear tips they have a little notch in them so that they don't slide around so they the earbuds fit a little bit more securely in your ears really the biggest difference these QC Ultra earbuds have from the QC earbuds 2 is that these have that immersive audio that I mentioned with the ultra headphones so they have that same feature that same spatial audio feature with head tracking the earbuds,197.879,621.843,130.261
CNET,xx53IGT1j3g,Earphone,Competitor,too don't have that that's really the QC Ultra earbuds in a nutshell they cost the same 299 dollars as the QC earbuds 2 and they'll ship in early October and Bose finally did release a third headphone it's just called the Bose quiet Comfort headphones there's no number it's replacing the Bose quiet Comfort 45 headphones and there really doesn't seem to be a whole lot of difference between the two however the new Bose quiet Comfort headphones do cost fifty dollars more they're 349. they do have some software upgrades most notably you can adjust the noise canceling to whatever level you want that was a feature on the headphone 700 as always let me know what you guys think in the comments section let me know what you think these headphones are too pricey is immersive audio a feature that you're really looking for that spatial audio and head tracking that'll make you upgrade and what do you think of the new design of the ultra I'm David carnai for CNET thanks for watching,262.68,621.843,136.35999999999999
CNET,dg4pGN0-h7Y,Earphone,Competitor,hi there i've got samsung's 230 galaxy buds 2 pro here which i keep referring to as the galaxy buds pro 2 because that's what i think the second generation of the galaxy buds pro should be called but hey i don't get to name products i just review them and i will say that these buds have an all-around better design than their predecessor which just didn't fit my ears all that well with the ear tips that were included not only are they 15 smaller but they weigh slightly less 5.5 grams per bud versus 6.3 grams and have a soft to the touch matte finish on both the buzz in case that gives them a nicer feel and makes them a bit more grippy and that finish also makes the compact case a little less likely to slip out of your hand and more importantly it helps keep the buds in your ears a little more securely and thanks to their new shape and smaller size i was able to get a tight seal with the largest set of included ear tips and didn't have to supply my own i can't say they'll fit all ears equally well but they should provide a better fit to more ears than the original galaxy buds pro [Music] aside from the revamped design samsung is touting the bud's improved noise cancelling and support for 24-bit high-resolution audio the catch is that to get that 24-bit audio you need a galaxy device equipped with samsung's one ui 4.0 and a music streaming service like qoba's title or amazon music that streams high-res audio tracks on all other devices including android phones and iphones the buds default to the aac audio codec they use bluetooth 5.3 alas they don't support the more common aptx adaptive audio codec for android devices only the new samsung seamless hifi codec which samsung says delivers 256 times more sound data than 16-bit cd quality audio numbers like that are a bit deceptive because based on my experience you're really only going to notice a small difference when streaming higher bitrate tracks but more on that after i ran out the rest of the feature set these have touch controls they work well but don't offer much in the way of customization and galaxy device owners can activate hands-free bixby samsung's voice assistant samsung's 360 audio virtual surround feature with head tracking returns in an enhanced version and now works with a,0.399,621.843,285.20099999999996
CNET,dg4pGN0-h7Y,Earphone,Competitor,variety of galaxy devices out of the gate though it's not compatible with other android devices it works along the same lines as apple's spatial audio feature for airpods and can enhance your movie and tv watching experience though it doesn't seem to be as pronounced as apple spatial audio which i think is slightly better overall it also works with music or any audio you're listening to the buds 2 pro are ipx7 water resistant which means they can withstand being fully submerged in one meter deep water for up to 30 minutes i had no problem running with them and they didn't slip out of my ears like their predecessor battery life is rated at five hours with noise cancelling on and eight hours with it off at moderate volume levels and you get about three additional charges in the case which charges via usbc and wirelessly some people are complaining that five hours is pretty mediocre and yeah it is but it's hard to shrink buds while increasing battery life and there is a quick charge feature to get you an hour use when you drop the buzz in the case for five minutes or two hours with a 10 minute charge so those battery life numbers weren't a deal breaker for me sensors detect when the buds are in your ears and will pause your music when you take both buds out of your ears but what's a little weird is they won't resume playback when you put them back in your ears without you tapping on one of the butts you can use a single bud while leaving the other one in the case additionally you can opt to activate a voice detect mode in the galaxy wearable companion app that automatically turns off noise canceling and switches to ambient mode when you speak allowing you to hear the outside world and engage in a conversation with someone sony offers a similar feature with this wf-1000x mark iv and link buds s earbuds another new feature worth mentioning has nothing to do with audio you can toggle on the next stretch reminder setting that detects your head position alerts you when you bend your head downward for 10 minutes that's a good one for all of us who stare down at our phones all the time while these have a find my buds feature that samsung calls smartthings fine it doesn't offer the more precise tracking capabilities of apple's enhanced find my in its latest airpods it just tells you,143.44,621.843,277.92
CNET,dg4pGN0-h7Y,Earphone,Competitor,the location where the bus last connected to your device you don't get true multi-point bluetooth pairing that allows you to pair the butt simultaneously with any two bluetooth enabled devices such as a phone and a computer but they do offer auto switching between samsung devices logged into your samsung account including samsung tvs built in 2022 or later and samsung's galaxy books laptops built after 2020. i haven't thoroughly tested the auto switching feature with many samsung devices because i just don't own that many samsung devices so i can't confirm exactly how reliably it works but feel free to let me know about any experiences you've had with it in the comments section samsung says it's improved the noise cancelling on the galaxy buds 2 pro by 40 percent it calls it intelligent anc now i have found it an improvement on the original galaxy but pro but noise cancelling performance is affected by how tight a seal you get from the ear tips so your perception of how much is improved may vary by how good a seal you get i thought the noise cancelling was close but not quite there with that of the noise cancelling the sony wf1000x mach 4 buds but it did a good job muffling a variety of noise on the streets of new york and in the subway you can turn the noise canceling off or activate ambient mode the equivalent of apple's transparency mode which i thought sounded pretty natural but there's no setting to adjust noise canceling levels it automatically adapts to your environment i appreciate that the buds 2 pro are equipped with two-way drivers a 10 millimeter woofer and 5.3 millimeter tweeter along with three microphones two of which are being forming for voice calls i paired the buds with a galaxy z flip 3 iphone 13 pro and google pixel 4 xl and stream music using quobas i also stream some movies from google play and netflix according to samsung there's no way to check whether you're getting 24 bit audio nothing indicates whether you are or you aren't but if your audio setup meets the list of requirements be using the samsung seamless hifi codec which transmits in 24 bit assuming your audio files support it i found it irritating there's no way to tell what bit rate you're streaming at but i'll have to take samsung's word that i was getting 24 bit audio,282.4,621.843,272.32
CNET,dg4pGN0-h7Y,Earphone,Competitor,i did notice a small difference when streaming tracks from quobas with the galaxy z flip 3 however using the iphone 13 pro the sound quality was also very good with an amply wide sound stage i went back and forth with different tracks and the flip 3 sound came across slightly more accurately the touch more detailed depth and clarity the base is punchy and well defined and i didn't experience any noticeable distortion at higher volumes in short they're excellent sounding buds but i'm not sure they're superior to other top earbuds in their price range including the pixelbuds pro beatsfit pro and sennheiser momentum true wireless 3 but their sound is a noticeable step up from the sound of the standard galaxy buds 2 particularly in terms of clarity i mostly went with the default sound setting though you can tweak the signature profile in the galaxy wearable app with some preset equalizer settings including a bass boost setting the truth is a lot of these premium priced earbuds are starting to sound pretty similar and it's really the fit and how they fit your particular ears that's going to make you like one more than another once again samsung has delivered a set of galaxy buttons that work well as a headset for making calls they have good voice pick up from the beam forming microphones while providing good background noise reduction callers so they could hear me relatively clearly in the noisy streets of new york and the buds did a decent job reducing wind noise they're in the upper echelon in terms of voice calling performance i'm in the streets of new york city here and i'm talking to john falcone a fellow editor how do i sound john there's a little bit of wind in the background here and some traffic is going by well if you're on a fairly noisy city street i'd have to rate the experience on my end as very good to excellent just hear a very slight kind of hiss that we sometimes get with noise cancelling but your voice is coming over loud and clear no artifacts or distractions and just a really good experience for the listener on my end all right i'll talk a little bit more now there as the traffic goes by you can see there's a lot of traffic a little bit of wind here,418.56,621.843,252.63799999999992
CNET,dg4pGN0-h7Y,Earphone,Competitor,big truck going by so hopefully you can hear me for better or worse galaxy butts have always been an accessory for galaxy smartphones and as a result more geared toward the owners of galaxy devices the galaxy buds 2 pro are no exception they're excellent earbuds but you do lose some of their key features if you're not a galaxy device owner for that reason it's easy to see them as the samsung equivalent of the airpods pro which may very well get some sort of high resolution wireless streaming option with the arrival of the airpods pro 2 that will likely use proprietary apple technology that only works with its devices by comparison the pixel buds pro have fewer features geared exclusively toward pixel owners and such features as hands-free google assistant and true multi-point bluetooth pairing are available across all android devices however the pixelbuds pro have no enhanced audio codec support which may be important if you're convinced it makes a big difference i personally think it only makes a slight difference with this class of earbuds which may have a premium price tag but aren't really high end the bigger question will be whether it's worth upgrading to the galaxy buzz 2 pro if you already own a pair of galaxy buds particularly the original galaxy buds pro i think that will largely depend on what price you can get the galaxy butts 2 pro for while their list price is 230 samsung is currently offering trade-in deals of any galaxy buzz in any condition that bring their price down to around 155 and you can often get deals on them as part of a bundle with a new galaxy phone for me anyway while the galaxy buzz 2 pro offers some legitimate performance improvements over their predecessor their design is the biggest upgrade that makes them the best galaxy buds yet but let me know what you guys think if you're a current galaxy buds pro owner are you going to upgrade to the buds 2 pro and would you still consider getting them even if you're not a samsung device owner sound off in the comment section if you're interested in any of the products mentioned check out the description below for links on where to find them and you can get even more details in my text review on cnet lastly if you found this video informative at all hit the like button and subscribe if you haven't already i'm david carnoy thanks for watching [Music],545.68,621.843,261.838
CNET,5-nSZEtu_eg,Earphone,Competitor,hey there folks i know a lot of you've been waiting for these sony's new wh 1000x mark 5 noise canceling headphones and they really are new they're redesigned on both the inside and outside and while you're probably not going to like their higher 400 price tag they have one key upgrade that's pretty killer so lots to talk about let's do it [Music] now when you have a product that a lot of people love it can be a little risky to change things up this is the fifth generation of the 1000x series headphones they were first released in 2016 as the mdr 1000x wireless they become increasingly popular as they've improved with each generation over the years sony has made some tweaks to design but nothing as dramatic as this gone is the dual hinge of previous models and now there's just a single hinge with a swivel and rocker design that means these full flat but they don't fold up and they come with a new carrying case that looks to be about 20 bigger than the previous models case that's a bit disappointing but the good news is the mark v weighs 4 grams less than the mark iv tipping the scales at a relatively spelt 250 grams they're also slightly more comfortable to wear they fit my head snugly but managed to avoid having that overly clamped feeling i happened to have a trip plan to france before i got my hands on a review sample so i was actually able to test these on a transatlantic flight and basically wore them for eight hours straight only taking them off for bathroom breaks they have the same battery life as the previous model up to 30 hours with a quick charge feature that gives you three hours of juice from a three minute charge but as i said they seem slightly more comfortable they also feature new synthetic leather ear pads that seem slightly more durable compared to the pads on the mark iv they do seem to breathe slightly better but as with any over ear headphones your ears are going to steam up pretty good if you wear them around when it's hot outside there doesn't seem to be any metal in the headband but the plastic appears to be pretty high tech and i spent some time contorting and twisting the,0.16,621.843,231.05
CNET,5-nSZEtu_eg,Earphone,Competitor,headband and nothing snapped the headphones come in two colors black and silver though the silver looks more like a sand color they both have nice matte finishes that don't show fingerprints aside from the larger case i personally prefer the new design to the mark fours but i'm sure there will be people who favor the mark four's design the markfy's features are very similar to the mark fours from the beginning the 1000x's signature extra feature was a quick attention mode if you hold your hand over the right ear cup it pauses whatever audio you're listening to and lets sound in so you can quickly have a conversation then go right back to what you're listening to also if you take the headphones off your head your music will pause and resume when you put them back on these also have sony speak to chat mode that's essentially hands-free quick attention if someone comes up to you and wants to chat you can simply say hey what's up and your audio pauses and the headphones go into ambient mode the audio then resumes after a short period of time anywhere from 5 seconds to 30 seconds depending on your preference or you can manually resume it by touching the ear cup the touch controls work quite well you swipe forward across the ear cup to advance tracks forward and swipe back to go to the previous track swiping up raises the volume swiping down lowers it and these have bluetooth 5.2 and are powered by sony's qn1 and v1 chips giving this headphone dual processors compared to the single processor of the mark iv according to sony that helps with noise canceling and noise reduction during calls and these have double the number of microphones for noise cancelling as well as what appears to be additional microphones dedicated to voice calling sony won't say how many beamforming microphones the mark iv has but this model has four of them so one of the biggest upgrades is to the microphone configuration the noise canceling was excellent with the mark iv and now it's even better with the mark v that said i didn't notice a real difference on my plane ride both models seem to do equally well with lower frequencies but according to,125.36,621.843,224.15800000000007
CNET,5-nSZEtu_eg,Earphone,Competitor,sony these do better muffling higher frequencies and i did notice some small differences walking around the streets of new york city for instance people's voices seem to be muffled slightly more i should also note that with the mark iv you had to manually engage the noise cancelling optimizer feature with this model it's automatically engaged and the adaptive noise cancelling does seem slightly smoother and more seamless you can manually toggle between noise cancelling in an ambient mode that lets sound in apple calls that mode transparency mode and while noise canceling levels aren't manually adjustable you can adjust the amount of ambient sound you want to let in at the highest ambient sound level you do get a bit of augmented hearing i can't get into all the features but there are eq settings in the app and you're probably going to end up playing around with them especially if you're used to the sound of the mark iv or mark iii aside from their higher price tag the biggest point of contention with these headphones will be their sound sony's equipped the mark v with new more rigid 30 millimeter carbon fiber drivers and these do sound markedly different from the mark iv they have more of an audio file sound profile with slightly more balanced sound better clarity and a bit tighter base going back and forth between the mark iv and mark v i noticed that the mark iv placed a little louder at the same volume level on my phone and is more forward and aggressive sounding it does have 40 millimeter drivers and i can see some people referring as bolder slightly more exciting sound especially if you listen to a lot of hip hop and bass heavy tracks i mostly prefer the more refined sound of the mark 5 but i suspect some reviewers may feel the headphones should offer a bigger perceived jump in sound quality based on their 400 price tag that's 50 more than what the mark 4 started out at but you can frequently find that model for around 270 or less i do expect to see some discounts on this new model in the not so distant future i do think this is a case of the headphones sounding different not better,237.599,621.843,220.96200000000002
CNET,5-nSZEtu_eg,Earphone,Competitor,or worse if you didn't have the mark iv to compare them to you would simply say to yourself they sound very smooth and accurate the way a good pair of headphones is supposed to sound like the mark iv these do support sony's ldec audio codec that's available for streaming over a number of android devices and certain dedicated music players i wirelessly stream music using an iphone 13 pro and a couple of android phones the qobuz music service offers high resolution tracks for streaming on android devices and computers and i did notice a slight uptick in sound quality when i went with l decker use the headphones in wired mode with the included cable that said i felt the difference in sound quality was bigger when i used the airpods max in wired mode the jump was even bigger with those headphones which do not offer ldac wireless streaming i'll finish with what i think is the biggest improvement over the mark iv and that's voice call quality it took them five tries but sony has finally cracked the code on noise reduction during calls these are truly impressive when it comes to calling in noisy environments all right so the wh 1000x mark 4 had improved call quality but for some people it wasn't quite good enough well now sony has said they've made the call quality better with these they have 4b four beamforming microphones as well as uh some software algorithms to reduce background noise i'm standing here in the streets of new york with a lot of cars going by i'm talking to another dave on the other line i'm having a conversation right now what do you think dave uh can is my voice clear and how much background noise are you hearing yeah so first off i'm not hearing any background noise if i didn't know any better i would have thought you were in a quiet room so definitely perks the headphones there the headphones slightly could focus on your voice and maybe you'd be a little bit more clear but in terms of eliminating voices it's doing an excellent job,348.0,621.843,242.47999999999996
CNET,5-nSZEtu_eg,Earphone,Competitor,right now there's a little bit of wind here as you can see from the tree in the background where you can't see that tree but it is quite windy here so um how's my voice sound now yeah your voice is sounding good um i guess whenever the wind's picking up there might be a slight shift in the tone of your voice but i don't hear any any wind noise or any background noise for that matter all right so there you have it that is our test call um much improved call quality for these uh bar fives last but not least these you have multi-point bluetooth pairing that allows you to pair the headphones with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them it's an important feature for some people particularly those of us who like to simultaneously pair with our phones and computers while working from home and that's really the sony wh-1000x mark 5 in a nutshell as i said there's going to be a lot of debate over whether the mark iv or the mark 5 sound better but the mark 5 has some legitimate upgrades and the voice calling experience is stellar for those of you who already own the mark iv that's really the biggest reason to upgrade to the mark 5. for those of you just looking for a new pair of noise-cancelling headphones i do think the mark 5 keeps sony right at the top of the category and if you can afford them i'd probably take these over bozes noise canceling 700 headphones as well as its quiet comfort 45 headphones which are also very good but i do think the mark 5 are slightly better overall not their voice calling has improved but let me know what you guys think how do you feel about the design changes and the higher 50 price tag and are any of you ready to dump your mark fours for the mark fives sound off in the comment section and if you're interested in any of the products mentioned check out the description below for links on where to find them and you can get even more details in my text review on cnet lastly if you found this video informative at all hit the like button and subscribe if you haven't already i'm david carney for cnet thanks for watching [Music],469.36,621.843,238.84
CNET,5VaCmyaLS9o,Earphone,Competitor,the pixel buds pro are official just announced at google i o and on paper these wireless earbuds have a lot going for them are we finally getting the perfect pair of pixel buds i really hope so two key things you need to know first up the first is that they finally have active noise cancellation that's something that's sorely been lacking on the earlier pixel buds and pixel buds a series number two they're not available just yet they're going on pre-order on july 21st for 199 us dollars we obviously don't have them in hand just yet but here is everything you need to know from all of the specs on paper to see how they stack up [Music] now the big promise here is of course the active noise cancelling or anc the pixel buds pro have a six core audio chip with google custom algorithms on board and something called silent seal now this is automatically going to adjust the anc depending on how these sit in your ears sounds super intriguing and i'm excited to see how this actually works when we get them in hand the other thing about anc earbuds is you might have experienced this some people really feel a sensation of built up pressure in their ears so the pixel buds pro are going to have sensors on board that is going to determine what that pressure is,0.56,621.843,161.28200000000007
CNET,5VaCmyaLS9o,Earphone,Competitor,and hopefully make the listening experience a little bit more comfortable for you of course having anc on board means that there is also going to be a transparency mode to let in sounds from the outside world to keep you more aware of your surroundings like a lot of other wireless earbuds there's several things going on behind the scenes automatically that is changing the properties of the sound say like apple's adaptive equalizer on the airpods pro the pixel buds pro have something called volume eq now this is adjusting the mids lows and highs of your music or say podcasts to automatically make sure the sound is balanced regardless of whether you have the volume cranked up really high or you're adjusting the volume to be a little bit lower spatial audio is coming to the pixel buds pro but later in the year it doesn't sound like it's available at launch now this is that virtual surround sound effect that places sound as objects in 3d space around you so it gives you that virtual effect when you are watching say supported movies or tv shows in certain apps and you're listening on a compatible pixel phone it's no surprise that the pixel buzz pro do have spatial audio support it's about time android 13 of course does have spatial audio support and dynamic head,87.36,621.843,149.04000000000002
CNET,5VaCmyaLS9o,Earphone,Competitor,tracking options and fingers crossed we don't just see this as an exclusive to pixel devices i really hope over time this does come to other android phones when using these earbuds too and it's time to celebrate because the pixel buzz pro will support multi-point bluetooth connectivity and be able to automatically switch between the last two connected bluetooth devices depending on what you're doing and it's not just for say like laptops and android devices google has said it's also going to work with ios devices too so that's pretty exciting now battery life is incredibly important for wireless earbuds and the pixel words pro on paper look like they're going to be among the best in class for anc buds at this kind of price range so 11 hours without active noise cancelling and seven hours with noise cancelling by comparison earbuds like the airpods pro get you around four and a half to five hours that's roughly the same as well as something like the samsung galaxy buds too and then if you step it up a little bit to the next tier you're getting something like the sony wf-1000 x mark fours that roughly get you around seven seven and a half maybe sometimes even eight hours of battery life when you have active noise cancelling turned on so it's good to see the pixel butts pro kind of got that,161.36,621.843,161.76
CNET,5VaCmyaLS9o,Earphone,Competitor,upper echelon there i'm i'm pleased of course being google earbuds these are going to support the google assistant hands-free in your ear not saying the wake word i'm not getting started with that and waking up all the devices in your house and they're also going to support real-time translation for up to 40 languages now the case of the earbuds itself is going to wirelessly charge as well as wire charging through usbc and of course it's going to be some sort of level of water resistance the difference is the case is actually only rated ipx2 while the buds themselves are ipx4 so a little bit more resistant on the buds themselves so you'll be able to use them say in the rain at the gym sweaty session and some light splashes of water and they should be fine and finally on the cosmetic side of things the pixel buds pro will come in four different colors a coral lemongrass charcoal and fog or as i would like to call them probably just pink kind of green uh gray and black but there's obviously a reason why i don't work in marketing and they are going to have interchangeable tips to adjust the fit of these in your ear because they are in-ear wireless earbuds all right so i do have a couple of lingering questions left on paper that i really hope that we find the answers to,242.08,621.843,152.63799999999998
CNET,5VaCmyaLS9o,Earphone,Competitor,sooner rather than later or at least the big things that i'm hoping they'll actually are going to fulfill the first is are these finally going to be kind of the airpods pro equivalent on the android slash pixel side i really really hope so because on paper there's a lot of promise here how are these going to fit in people's ears they look a little bit more elongated than earlier pixel buds and they don't really have those kind of like in-ear hooks that the pixel buds a series had so i'm hoping that these are going to be a fairly universal fit and pretty comfortable what sort of audio codecs are we getting is there going to be support for high resolution uh streaming on android i mean probably not going to be sony zelda codec obviously but you know support for other formats i'm really intrigued to find out but i would love to know your thoughts on what we know so far about the pixel buds pro leave me your comments down below maybe your wish list what you think about the price and don't forget they are not available yet july 21st for 199 us dollars i've got lots more useful links down in the description below thanks for watching and stay tuned to cnnet for lots more coverage from google i o see ya [Music] you,318.639,621.843,153.92199999999997

CNET,AKCnRH20F_M,Earphone,Competitor,the galaxy buds 2 are samsung's latest pair of true wireless earbuds they have active noise cancellation they have sound tuned by akg and they have a lightweight design but are these features everything they're stacked up to be well let's find out and dive into the review it feels like samsung comes out with new earbuds pretty much every six months first we had the buds live then the buds pro then finally we have the buds 2 which kind of sit right in the middle of those two earbuds at fifty dollars less than the buds pro the buds too definitely do feel like a lighter more flexible version of those earbuds and they come in four different colors a white and a black which is your standard color options and then to mix things up a little bit you get a green or a lavender version which is the version that i've been using in the box you get the buds themselves the wireless charging case a usbc cable and three sizes of interchangeable tips each bud weighs 5 grams or 0.17 ounces each they support bluetooth 5.2 they're ipx2 water resistant and the case supports wireless charging cosmetic options aside the buds too are actually smaller and lighter than the buds pro and if you're someone who's previously found that a lot of in-ear buds are a little bit too big and bulky these ones actually might fit the bill for me and my slightly smaller than average ears i find that they're very comfortable to wear they fit snugly without feeling too tight and i can definitely wear them for extended periods of time without having any sort of ear fatigue that being said if you are upgrading from something like the buds plus well you might be a little bit disappointed because these buds do not come with wing tips and those are those bits that go around the earbud themselves to kind of nestle them much,0.24,621.843,209.6
CNET,AKCnRH20F_M,Earphone,Competitor,more snugly in your ear i didn't find it to be too much of a problem but i didn't do anything super active with these and i definitely wouldn't choose these primarily for a higher intensity workout but for a light jog or maybe some light gym use i think they should be fine the galaxy wearable app does come with an ear fit test and this will help you decide which ear tip is the right size for your particular ear shape unfortunately the galaxy wearable app is not available on ios with the buds too so if you're an iphone user yes you can pair these buds with ios not a problem within the regular bluetooth settings but you're not going to be able to use that galaxy wearable app to be able to change things like your touch panel controls your equalizer and so on that's only available on android and on galaxy devices [Music] let's talk sound quality if you're a fan of how samsung and akg tune their audio especially from previous earbuds you will not be too surprised with what the sound profile is like on these particular buds overall they are nice and bright tracks from a range of different genres sound nice and dynamic and there is a lot of bass to these i'm normally the sort of person that needs to go in and add more bass through an equalizer but i have to say these have so much bass on the default or the normal profile that it's almost a little bit too much for me with some particular songs that i was listening to particularly some r b and hip-hop tracks which are so deep and so booming i actually had to go in and turn it down a little bit through one of those equalizer settings so if you like your bass these little buds actually have pretty big and booming sound overall the sound stage is a little bit more restricted than the buds pro so it doesn't feel like a lot of the instrumentation has as much room to,110.0,621.843,219.921
CNET,AKCnRH20F_M,Earphone,Competitor,breathe but i was not super surprised about that just given that these are less expensive than the buds pro i think they do sound pretty good for their price as for noise cancellation i feel like the buds too do a fairly good job across a range of different frequencies in blocking out that ambient white noise but they're not the best for the money i would say that they did a slightly better job at higher frequencies say for things like an overhead fan or a heating unit those were less noticeable to me than lower more rumbling constant frequencies say like commuting noise or even traffic noise that did tend to come through a little bit more for my ears the buds too also have an ambient sound mode so you can let in some sounds from the external world so you're more aware of your surroundings they have three different levels you can choose from within the galaxy wearable app which i really like although i would recommend only using the highest setting when you are indoors it's just really magnifies everything when you are outside and it left me with a bit of a headache because i left it on my accident [Music] all right call and microphone quality time i'm recording this in the galaxy note 20 ultra using pro video mode using the bluetooth microphone aka the galaxy but 2 as the microphone and while this isn't fully representative of the quality of a phone call i think it gives you some idea of what these earbuds can do so samsung says that the buds to have machine learning to block out a range of different background noises and when i was on phone calls callers would remark they pretty much couldn't hear any background noise like if i was walking alongside traffic they had no idea if i was standing with a noisy fan overhead they couldn't hear that either and that was pretty interesting for me especially because i'm used to taking calls outside,219.84,621.843,205.51900000000003
CNET,AKCnRH20F_M,Earphone,Competitor,all the time and people are like here you can't hear you but they did say that my voice was modulated slightly differently when there was a lot of background noise and maybe you'll be able to hear that example in this particular clip here now overall i found that they were really really strong for phone calls especially from the recipients and then also in my end they sounded really good as well on computer-based calls say like on the zoom or google hangouts and things like that they weren't as strong and people were like well they don't sound as good but overall it gives you an idea of what these can do and hopefully this has provided you the sound of silence and my voice let's touch on all the other features as well as the all-important battery life the buds too have touch panels as i mentioned and they're fully customizable in the galaxy wearable app i really like how you can change one of the settings to be a volume up or down something that more buds are starting to come out with but i really like that it's on these and you can also obviously change tracks and also change between active noise cancellation ambient sound or turning that setting off altogether there's also a lab section within the app for lower latency when playing games and one accessibility feature that i really like is the ability to use just one earbud with active noise cancellation so you don't always have to have both in and they also have automatic switching between galaxy devices signed into the same samsung id you can activate bixby with your voice you can also get notifications read aloud in your ear and you can toggle on the apps that you want to come through within the galaxy wearable app and you can also find these buzzers location on a map battery life is fairly standard for earbuds with this kind of feature set i was able to get around 5 hours and,322.88,621.843,203.20100000000002
CNET,AKCnRH20F_M,Earphone,Competitor,20 minutes of listening time with anc turned on that was just a little bit extra than the five hours that samsung stated on the box but i wasn't listening at 50 volume it was probably more like 40 so of course the louder you listen probably the faster they're going to drain at seven and a half hours with anc turned off that's fairly good except it's nowhere near as strong as the 11 hours that were on the galaxy buds plus so if you're looking for the spiritual successor of those in terms of long battery life you are probably going to be a little bit disappointed in the buds too the case itself obviously holds some extra charge it's 20 hours of total listening time with active noise cancellation and 29 hours with it off so i would get the butts too if i was looking specifically for a set of wireless earbuds that were lightweight with active noise cancellation and good call quality and i think if you're upgrading from something like the original galaxy buds or the buds plus you will notice a couple of extra features and some design differences here that might make it actually really worthwhile to you and i think that these are actually a better buy than the galaxy buds pro especially at their 200 retail price so unless you need things like ipx7 water resistance or 360 audio or adjustable active noise cancellation settings i think these are the ones to go for but you've got lots of different earbuds to choose from around the 150 mark and maybe something like say the beats studio buds might be a better choice if you are someone that's switching between android and ios quite a lot they have also fairly effective transparency mode as well of course we've got lots of extra headphone comparisons coming your way here on cnet and on cnet.com right now so thanks for watching and of course if you have any other questions about these earbuds that i did not answer you can hit me up in the comments instagram twitter you know same old places you got my number thanks for watching see ya,426.56,621.843,227.04099999999997
CNET,51L4Oa1S3RE,Earphone,Competitor,these are google's new pixel buds a series that a stands for affordability and like google's a series pixel phones they may be next gen but they're not exactly an upgrade but they only cost 99 which is a big price cut so let's jump right into the review and see whether they really are a bargain or not as i said looks wise not much has changed they feature the same likable design as the pixel buds 2 with that integrated sport bin and relatively discreet look they don't stick out of your ears as much as other earbuds do there are some small differences however for starters they are a little bit lighter than the pixel buds 2 google says about 20 lighter across the earbuds and the case along with clearly white they now come in this new dark olive color and they incorporate slightly different materials and aren't two-tone the inside of the buds have a glossy as opposed to a matte finish and its color matches the color of the outside of the buds additionally the inside of the case also has a glossy finish and its color matches the color of the buds the other thing you'll notice is that the nozzle that you attach the ear tip to is now made of plastic instead of metal which presumably is more durable the case is the same it's nice and compact but unlike the pixel buds too the a series does not have wireless charging just usbc charging these are also missing the swipe for volume control feature you,0.0,621.843,172.562
CNET,51L4Oa1S3RE,Earphone,Competitor,can't run your finger across the bud to adjust volume you don't have to use the volume controls on the device you're streaming with or access google assistant then tell it to raise or lower the volume the a series doesn't have the attention alerts feature that detects certain ambient sounds like a baby crying dog barking or an emergency vehicle siren and alerts you to those sounds while you're wearing the buds the feeling that not too many people bothered with that experimental feature but a lot of people like the swipe to control volume feature personally i can live without it for the price reduction the last little design changes i should mention are these have two charging pins as opposed to three on the pixel buds too and there's also a sensor on the pixel buds too that isn't on these guys when i saw that i was a little bit worried about the ear detection feature where if you pull an earbud out of your ear while you're listening to music it'll auto pause your music and then resume it when you put it back in well that feature is still here when i ask google about it they said they were able to optimize ear detection with just one ir sensor and so little changes like that can help reduce the weight of the earbuds just a tad like the pixel buds 2 these are equipped with bluetooth 5.0 but they're powered by a new chipset when the pixelbuds 2 first came out there were widespread complaints,91.2,621.843,164.87999999999997
CNET,51L4Oa1S3RE,Earphone,Competitor,that the wireless connectivity wasn't rock solid people were getting some dropouts and while subsequent firmware upgrades improved performance google appears to have addressed any connectivity issues with the a series i had no dropouts during my three days of testing so in that sense they are upgraded as far as i can tell they sound the same as the pixelbuds 2 or very similar anyway to get optimal sound you do need a tight seal but you should be able to get one with one of the three different sized ear tips these are relatively lightweight and comfortable to wear and they stayed in my ears well they have an ipx4 water resistance rating which means they're splash proof and i had no issues running with them or using them at the gym they sound quite good overall with ample bass that's not loose or bloated and these have decent clarity although there's just a touch of treble push that can lead to some edginess on less well-recorded tracks they don't have the richer more open and refined sound of higher end earbuds like sennheiser's momentum true wireless 2 or sony's wf-1000x series but their sound measures up well against other earbuds in this price range there's a bass boost mode that i did prefer along with an adaptive sound mode that automatically raises and lowers volume according to the amount of ambient noise around you but the eq options are pretty limited these support streaming using the aac,175.68,621.843,169.28

CNET,51L4Oa1S3RE,Earphone,Competitor,as i said from the outset this is a bit of an unusual product because it's next-gen but not really an upgrade for owners of the previous model but it's a smart move by google as it tries to expand its audience for its true wireless buds this sub 100 price point is where it needs to play you've got samsung's galaxy buds plus selling for around 110 and then there are the anker liberty air 2 pro earbuds and amazon echo buds at 130 both of those feature active noise canceling but they're already being discounted to 100 sometimes so they are direct competitors i don't know if the pixel buds a are necessarily any better than those guys it kind of depends on just how good they feel in your ears but when you factor in their strong design good sound quality and excellent headset performance the a series are a very good value at 99 and a great choice for android users although they work with apple ios devices there's no companion app for apple users so you should probably steer clear unless you have an android device for doing firmware upgrades but what do you guys think are you okay with the corners google cut to get the price down and who's disappointed google didn't come out with true next-gen pixel buds that add active noise cancelling and improve sound albeit for probably double the price let me know what you think in the comments section and if you found anything redeeming about this video hit the like button and subscribe if you haven't already i'm david carney for cnet thanks for watching,347.759,621.843,191.76
CNET,S9jcm9xAaLc,Earphone,Competitor,so you're looking for a pair of wireless noise cancelling headphones well you've come to the right place you might be choosing between something like the airpods max maybe you're looking at the sony wh 1000 x mark fours or it could be the bose noise cancelling 700 i've been using all three headphones for several weeks and i'm here to help you make that decision and work out which one is right for you hey there my name is lexie and i love testing out headphones i had so much fun making this video because i got to listen to a lot of music now i'm going to cover off everything about these three headphones from sound quality to active noise cancellation transparency mode or ambient sound mode as well as connectivity battery life overall performance and call quality so let's get started [Music] your first decision is likely to do with price the airpods max are the most expensive of the bunch at 550 the sony's are the cheapest generally of the bunch at around 350 and the bose 700s are in the middle at around 370 dollars now of course those are just the retail prices if you want to find out the most up-to-date pricing you can check out the links in the description below let's take a look at what's in each of the headphones boxes the bose 700 you get a hard carrying case a 2.5 to 3.5 millimeter audio cable and a usbc cable for charging with the sony wh 1000 x mark fours you get a hard case a 3.5 millimeter audio cable a usb c cable for charging and a headphone adapter for using on an airplane with the airpods max you get a smart case a lightning cable for charging and that's it there's no audio cable included in the box and if you do want to buy that for listening to a wired audio source you're going to have to fork out another 35 at least on top of 550 dollars you've spent on a pair of headphones that doesn't even come with a protective case now i thought look there's a great way to get around this because i don't want to spend another 35 plus dollars i'm going to try and use that 3.5 to lightning little adapter jack great i've i've solved the problem doesn't work don't buy it it's not gonna work [Music] sound quality is arguably the most important part of any headphone and i've listened to a range of music across different genres from different sources to help give you an idea of what these actually sound like and the whole listening experience let's start with the bose 700s now these ones when i first put them on my ears i really noticed that the base was nice deep and really rich it was a lovely listening experience on my favorite playlist the sound profile was a little bit more neutral overall compared to say the sony's for example but i really enjoyed that and i found that like the whole sound profile and the sound stage was quite tight so i definitely didn't feel like anything was getting lost there was no muddiness and i just really enjoyed listening to these particular headphones now the bose also come with an app for ios and android that lets you adjust the equalizer so too does the sony so that basically means that you'll be able to adjust the sound profile if you don't like the defaults you can do that in the app now the sound profile on the sony's these ones for my ears are the most warm out of all of these three headphones the bass is booming and i just really loved listening to these as well what i would say is that the sound on the sony's to me it sounds a little bit weird to say this but it sounds the most intimate and so i really felt like i was up close and personal with my music when i was listening into the sony's it was just vibrant and exciting to listen to a range of different tracks the sony's also come with a digital sound enhancement engine and that's basically to give a little bit of boost to sounds that are coming from streaming apps say like spotify or apple music now if you are an apple music lover i definitely think that the airpods max are going to sound the best overall i noticed when i was listening to say spotify and apple music on an ios device i could feel and hear the difference on the,0.48,621.843,528.1600000000002
CNET,S9jcm9xAaLc,Earphone,Competitor,airpods max now overall this being the most expensive of the three headphones they definitely have to meet the widest sound stage but the base is not as punchy straight off the bat but the mids and the trebles are super well defined i really found when i was listening to vocals and strings especially on the airpods max they sounded beautiful so clean and so clear and also when you crank the volume up really high there's really no distortion at all which is fantastic if you really like to pump your music now the airpods max comes with what's called an adaptive equalizer now this is automatically changing the sound properties of the headphones depending on a number of different variables like how the headphones fit on your head but there isn't a way to universally control it manually so if you do want to change the sound profile you're going to have to do that either in an app like spotify through that equalizer or if you're listening on apple music for example in your ios settings you can change the equalizer too now let's talk about active noise cancellation and transparency mode or ambient sound mode so these three headphones are all excellent at blocking out the sounds of the external world through active noise cancellation and all three definitely pass the someone comes up behind you tries to offer you a cup of tea and you get the living daylight scared out of you because you didn't hear them test but because i haven't been able to travel and use them in a situation where active noise cancellation is arguably the most a crucial part of the listening experience which is on an airplane i've been able to recreate a white noise situation at home with a noisy overhead heating unit i've tested all three listening to both music playing at the time and not having music playing at the time and they've all done an excellent job now i think to my ears the best noise cancelling experience was from the airpods max this doesn't surprise me because they're the most expensive headphones and also have the most microphones dedicated to noise cancelling the bose and the sony were also excellent and honestly if i hadn't listened to the airpods max with the anc turned on these would be absolutely top of their class and they really are i think the bows are probably a little bit better at blocking out those kind of lower frequencies but overall the kind of most seamless performance for me was from the airpods max now as for transparency mode or ambient sound mode this mode actually pipes in sounds of the external world to give you some more awareness of your surroundings so you don't you know walk into traffic get hit by a car or you can hear things like a screaming baby when you're jamming out to your tunes because that's pretty important now again for my ears the airpods max actually did the best job overall with transparency mode it is the most natural sounding to my ears and really if you've used any other pair of apple headphones such as the airpods pro it's a very similar experience with the airpods max apple just does a really good job of transparency mode again the others too are really good at the ambient sound modes but it just doesn't sound as natural and as organic it just does sound a little bit more like microphones are compensating and trying to pipe in some sound whereas with the airpods max i generally feel like i can have a conversation with you super easily and i can hear everything that's going on here my own voice i'm not shouting things like that but i really do appreciate that the sony's do have an actual slider where you can change the level of the ambient sound mode coming in so you can either make it super loud if you're in a situation where you really need to have high sensitivity to what's going on around you or you can be very low so you can only hear just some voices and things come through the bows on the other hand have an adjustable noise cancellation setting so it can be anywhere from one to ten which i personally love having an adjustable noise cancellation setting the other two it's either only on or off now let's talk about the comfort the design and the controls of all three headphones starting off with the airpods max now these headphones look honestly they're heavy i've been using them for over three months now and when i first took them out of the box and put them on my head i just thought look they're just too heavy maybe i can get used to them it's been three plus months now and i'm still not used to the weight of these,269.199,621.843,526.959
CNET,S9jcm9xAaLc,Earphone,Competitor,headphones they're a lot heavier than the other two and that's to do with their construction there is the stainless steel telescopic arms there's the aluminium or aluminum ear cups and a mesh headband that's used to distribute the weight a little bit better across your head now yes i think the mesh headband really does make a difference overall but if you're at all sensitive to any sort of weight on your head or any kind of clamping force the airpods max might be a little bit too heavy for you the airpods max do have some other redeeming features especially around the cups they are the deepest and the biggest of all of the three headphones and i really like that especially if you have larger ears or someone who's found that your ears generally press up against other noise cancelling headphones you probably won't have that issue with the airpods max the only other problem with the earbuds max though is you see these cups that come off like this yeah that's great but um you know if you choose the lighter color like me because this was the only option available when i ordered them they're going to get pretty dirty i wear makeup and it just gets lots of dirt and grime so i recommend either getting a darker pair with the darker cups or giving them a bit of a clean but fortunately you can take them off like so and clean them pretty easily now the bow 700s have a plastic construction on the cups as well as nice foam padded ear cups and a nice padded headband like so now this actual headband itself is stainless steel so it is a little bit heavier even though overall it's the same weight as the sony's and much much lighter than the airpods max which i really appreciate now overall these were super comfortable to wear but there is a massive design fault if you have long hair like me and you like to take off your headphones and rest them on your neck like this when you don't have your hair tied up well let me just tell you i've lost a lot of hair and i've had to go to some extreme measures to get my hair untangled from these headphones so definitely do be careful if you have long hair and you wear these now fortunately sony does not have the problem of your hair getting caught in these the design is a little bit more simple there isn't a headband that's kind of a different design to the rest of the headphone themselves again it is a plastic construction with nice padded ear cups and a padded headband like so to me these ones actually felt the lightest and the most comfortable to wear all day which i really appreciated and when it did come to an extended listening session i definitely felt like i was just wanting to pick up the sony's and put them on my head more often than the other two they were just much more comfortable overall both the bose and the sony come with physical buttons and touch panels so the buttons are for powering on and off the headphone as well as switching between active noise cancellation your other modes and activating your voice assistant perhaps if you want to do that i found the touch panels were both really responsive on both i think for me the design of the sony's was just a little bit better overall because that entire front touch panel on the cup you can actually use that entire surface and control the headphone whereas the bose i found that i was just rubbing up against the actual where the headband meets the ear cup a little bit much it was just it wasn't as easy for me to get to know them as it was the sonys now the airpods macs do not have touch panels they have simply two buttons you can either use the digital crown to rotate do things like change the volume answer calls and so on switch between tracks and one button to activate noise cancellation and transparency mode now at first i thought look this is not as going to be as flexible as other over-ear headphones just because i like having more buttons and things to press and things to tweak but actually i think in this case the simplicity was actually a really good part about the airpods max for me it didn't take me very long at all to learn which button did what whereas the other two there's just a little bit more muscle memory involved again your mileage may vary but i just found that the simplicity of the airpods max was nice i want you to actually hear the microphone from each and see what you think bose nc 700 testing on the iphone 12 pro take a listen to the microphone and see which one you like so it's time on android take a listen to how the microphone sounds in the camera app,534.959,621.843,542.122

CNET,S9jcm9xAaLc,Earphone,Competitor,mac with big sur and above and be signed into the same apple id on all those devices to be able to switch seamlessly between the two it works for me i'd say like 80 to 85 percent of the time and the rest of the time i do have to double check which one that i'm actually connected to but the airpods max do have really really rock solid connectivity when it you are on ios and also the h1 chips make sure that connection when you first establish it with a phone for example you get that nice pop-up and it does it every single time thereafter the bose and the sony are also really good at connecting to these devices but you don't get that nice visual interface and it's just an extra step of having to go through the app to set it up rather than just seamlessly being able to do it on the airport's max with an ios device all three headphones have really good and really strong battery life now the manufacturer claims of the bose in the airpods is around 20 hours i've done my own tests on all of them the airpods max gave me around 20 hours and 20 minutes of listening time at around 50 volume and active noise cancellation turned on the bose got me a little closer to 21 hours actually which was pretty impressive but the sony's look these ones were the best overall in terms of battery life manufacturer claim is 30 hours and i pretty much met that and got a little bit extra out of them so i was really impressed the fact that these were the lightest on my head and also gave me the longest listening time between charges was pretty impressive one other thing to keep in mind about battery life is that the bose and the sony you can use in a passive mode with wired listening if your battery is dead the airpods max unfortunately don't have any kind of passive mode so when the battery goes even if you've got that 35 cable you're out of luck you need to give them a recharge fortunately all three also have a fast recharge option that gives you just a little bit of extra juice in say a 10 or 15 minute period overall the sony's just gave me a little bit more more quickly than the other two so now you know everything about these three headphones it's the hard part of the video where i have to make a decision and you also need to make a choice about which ones that you like the most if you are making the buying decision or maybe you already have one of these pairs and you're like i hope she chooses the one that i bought well let me tell you all three are fantastic and i loved using all of them as i said straight off the top of the video but i really do want to make kind of a frankenstein's monster headphone that incorporates the best part of all three now i obviously can't do that but i will give you some guidelines on which ones i think are the best for certain applications for the best sound and calls if those two things are very important to you i would choose the bose 700s i really liked the sound profile the bass was deep and rich and the call quality was excellent but the best sound for the price 100 is the sony's warm and just it's like a big warm hug when you're listening to your music it gives you the goosebumps when you're listening to your favorite tunes i loved listening to these and you honestly can't beat the price especially because they're usually a little bit cheaper than their retail price of 350. for the best noise cancellation and transparency mode i'm going to choose the airpods max i also think that these are probably the best choice if you have an iphone and you don't mind a heavier headphone they are an incredibly rich and rewarding listening experience and the transparency mode as i mentioned is the most natural overall but for me it's hard to get past that weight they're just too heavy for me and you're probably thinking lexi you've got to choose one right you've got to choose one and help me out so for all encompassing all of those categories price battery life comfort sound quality i'm going to choose the sony wh-1000 x mark fours these ones were just a joy to listen to very comfortable to wear they work well across android and ios plus the sound is warm rich and inviting thanks so much for watching i hope this has been super helpful for you in working out which headphone is the right one for you make sure to hit that like button and subscribe if you want to catch up with lots more headphones and audio content here on cnet and if you have any more questions about each of these headphones you can hit me up in the comments or on your favorite social media platform i'll see you next time,1079.2,621.843,560.32
CNET,UupKX-NSEOU,Earphone,Competitor,when it comes to wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation you have plenty of options to choose from and the latest is the samsung galaxy buzz pro hey everyone my name is lexie and i love wireless earbuds now i've been using the galaxy buds pro for about a week and i thought it would be fun to compare them to apple's airpods pro which i've been using for a lot longer in this video i am going to compare them on everything from design to fit to how they perform battery life and of course sound quality so let's get started [Music] the first thing you probably need to know about these two earbuds is the price now the airports pro are around 250 us dollars that's their full retail price whereas the galaxy buds pro are around 50 dollars cheaper around 200 us dollars so that's the first thing to bear in mind when comparing these two the second thing is ecosystem now i've been testing samsung galaxy buds for a long time and this is actually the first generation in which i believe that your ecosystem or the phone that you use actually plays a really big choice in which buds is the right one for you so the first time in a long time if you own a galaxy device or an android device the buzz pro are probably going to be your best bet whereas if you're on an iphone or ios it's going to be the airpods pro so with that in mind let's dive into design [Music] these two earbuds couldn't be any more different in terms of design if they tried the airpods pro sit in your ear like the buzz pro however there is a stem that sticks down from your ear and you can use it to change between tracks turn on and off active noise cancellation and transparency mode and so on the buds pro are a complete bud design there's no part that really sticks down from your ear although it does protrude out a little bit more and they are a little bit heavier in my ear than the airpods pro now it has a touch panel on the side that you can do pretty much the same things on the airpods pro except you're tapping instead of clicking the stem you can do things like skip back and forth between tracks your voice assistant and noise cancellation and so on so pretty similar in that regard in terms of controls as you can probably see on the airpods pro i have changed out the default silicon ear tips of which there are three sizes two foam ear tips i actually find that these ones actually just give me a bit more of a secure fit in the ear because i did find that they were always falling out when i was doing something active like running or moving around that would just drop out of my ear so the foam tips actually provide a much more secure fit i definitely recommend looking into third-party foam tips if you have similar issues with the airbox pro now the buds pro are different to any other samsung buds that i've tested before in terms of the actual bud shape itself of that tip around it is an oval instead of a circle so this might make a difference in how it fits in your ear in my ear they don't fit as securely as previous samsung galaxy buds such as the buds plus although i am looking forward to trying some different third-party tips with these as well to see if i can improve the fit and like the airpods pro there are three different tip sizes that come in the box so you can plug and play and choose the ones that fit to your liking there aren't any wing tips though however which is kind of annoying,0.08,621.843,405.0399999999997
CNET,UupKX-NSEOU,Earphone,Competitor,because the galaxy buds plus really fit really really well and snuggly in my ears and these ones don't stay in as well for things like working out however your mileage will vary i just have really strange really small ears now let's talk about water resistance this one is very different on the two the buds pro are rated ipx7 now this means essentially they are water resistant or waterproof i guess you could say up to 30 minutes in three feet of fresh water so you could theoretically use these to swim with and i know a lot of people do like to try and listen to music while they swim i haven't tried swimming with these because it's really cold but i am going to try and do a bit of a water test with them maybe put them through the washing machine for 30 minutes see how they last uh that one is going to be fun to do now the airports pro by contrast are only rated ipx4 so this means they're able to withstand some splashes and uh some sweat obviously but not as water resistant as the buds pro and lastly color options you get three on the galaxy buds pros you either have black silver or a purple called phantom color don't know why and the airports pro are available only in white i kind of like putting the black tips on the white airpods because it kind of makes it look a little cooler and you know it's like panda versus phantom sounds kind of neat okay let's talk about sound quality because that to me is the most important part in determining which wireless earbud is the right one for my application so let's start with the airpods pro now if you've watched any of my previous comparisons with the airpods pro or any of my airpods pro videos you'll know that i think that they have a fairly balanced sound profile but it's not that exciting okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to listen to my let's turn it into transparency mode so i can actually hear myself great so i'm going to actually listen to my playlists that i usually use to test wireless earbuds let me know what they sound like okay all right so the first one i always like to listen to is childish gambino's red bone but like that pumping bass a great beat okay airpods pro it's really balanced so what is happening is that the base is not too prominent you know that kick at the start it's nice but it's not like that big thump that you get on some other wireless earbuds it sounds good it's very balanced the mids and trebles are also really well defined but it's not super exciting it's good i love this tune okay so it sounds really nicely defined but not exciting and that adaptive equalizer that the airpods pro comes with is basically changing the sound profile based on a number of different variables like the shape of your ears now there is an equalizer that you can change the settings with with the airpods pro on apple music or you can also change it in spotify but there isn't kind of like a universal equalizer for the airpods pro which is something that i really like like buds pro do have that so let's switch over and listen to the buds pro all right listening to the galaxy buds pro now again with the ambient sound on so i'm not shouting at you all right let's listen to the playlist again take a listen okay first thing i noticed is that bass right off the top that drum hit it's so deep like it really really sounds much more prominent and in your face i really like a big heavy base on my earbuds well not too heavy but you know heavy so it actually makes an impact with what i'm listening to,203.04,621.843,450.48200000000014
CNET,UupKX-NSEOU,Earphone,Competitor,these sound a lot more exciting and definitely much more warm and rich like those mids and trebles really do fill the space really well i do think that these are the best sounding samsung earbuds that i've heard at least i really do like the sound profile and that's just on the default settings on the equalizer you can also change it to a bass boost which i really like the most actually soft dynamic clear and treble boost so you do have a couple different options to choose from yeah like it's just really nice to listen to music on these but that said i think the most balanced for me is the airpods pro when it comes to doing things like jumping between calls and listening to podcasts just because it's much more neutral and even whereas these ones probably a little bit too booming on calls not necessarily a bad thing but i do prefer using the airforce pro as a daily driver and these ones for music just going to be here for a while jamming out now active noise cancellation is a key reason why you would buy one of these two earbuds and it's very effective on both now obviously because i haven't been able to use the buds pro to do things like travel on an airplane or commuting like i have previously with the airpods pro i wasn't able to test them side by side in that environment but i was able to recreate a noisy white noise with an overhead fan and also a heating system and listen to them both side by side now i do have to say that the airports pro for me just edged out the galaxy buzz pro but just by a very small margin still both of them are excellent and you shouldn't have any complaints when it comes to anc at all but i did find that i really like that kind of swamp effect of the airpods pro when the anc kicks in just doesn't have that wow factor for me on the buds pro either and there also is to my very sensitive ears a tiny little bit of a hiss when the anc is active on the buds pro whereas i can't hear that on the airpods pro now transparency mode or ambient sound mode now this pipes in external sound so you are more aware of your surroundings whether that's something like a crying baby or street traffic now again both of these are pretty effective i have to say apple does probably the best job of any transparency or ambient sound mode on any of the wireless earbuds that i have tried it just sounds super natural and you don't have to tweak any settings to get it to sound pretty much perfect now the ambient noise on the galaxy buds pro you can actually change the volume level of it so it can be either high medium or low and that i actually found was super helpful but that being said don't do what i did which was walk outside on a beautiful day just to go for a walk with the setting still on high because i was indoors um i walked up to the traffic lights with a stream of traffic and i almost died myself because it was so loud and i didn't realize that i still had it on um high but the one trick that the buzz pro does have up its sleeve that the airports doesn't and i really think this is a fantastic feature is voice detection so if you're listening to music and you want to have a quick conversation with someone but you don't want to either take the butt out of your ear fumble around for your phone switch to transparency mode tap the butt whatever have you what you can do is just start talking and the buds will detect when you're actually speaking and moving your mouth and so then the music kind of ducks and it goes into that ambient sound mode,432.8,621.843,422.0789999999999
CNET,UupKX-NSEOU,Earphone,Competitor,the volume goes down it's super effective and i absolutely love that feature it was so helpful for me when i just didn't want to have to quickly like pull one out of my ear again don't do what i did and if you sing along to your music a lot at home this feature will turn on when you are singing along to your favorite song so um yeah i did it and then it was kind of like a very sad karaoke session when i realized what was happening because the music stopped and i was still singing okay mike sample time this is the galaxy buds pro as you can see i am recording audio from the microphone into pro video mode on the note 20 ultra not the s21 all triggered that's coming soon but for the time being it's exactly the same functionality so you can take a listen to what the microphones sound like as you can see i'm in exactly the same position just without the lavalier mic just with the microphone from the buds when i was using these callers remarked that my voice kind of sounded a little bit more close and a little bit louder than that on the airpods pro and again on the airpods pro this time on the iphone 12 pro and recording through filmic pro not the default camera app on the iphone so take a listen again exactly the same situation you can hear which microphone you prefer the most i think for me in terms of calls i really did think the experience was almost exactly the same in terms of listening with active noise cancellation on and taking calls it was just super immersive and they both sounded great now let's talk about features of both of these earbuds now as i said at the start this is the first time that samsung has really made the buds pro specifically designed for galaxy or android devices as opposed to having compatibility with the ios version of the galaxy wearable app you can pair them to an iphone if you do have the galaxy birds pro but you just don't get that compatibility with the app or at least not at the time of writing just so you can't change the controls to your liking they're just like a regular pair of bluetooth earbuds now both of these earbuds do have spatial audio effects which gives you a virtual surround sound experience it is called spatial audio on the airpods pro or 360 audio on the buds pro now it's available on ios 14 devices and later if you're using the airpods pro and currently only on galaxy s21 devices on the buds pro now i did test both of them and i used the same movie on hbo max i really thought the effect was great i did think though that the airpods pro just sounded a little bit more natural for me when i was moving my head around to get that virtual surround experience now both of these buds also have a quick switching feature to quickly go between different devices if you are signed into the samsung account across a bunch of different samsung or galaxy devices and also your apple id on a bunch of different ios devices they also have voice assistant and can read messages allowed in your ear if you like that it is siri on the airpods pro and bixby on the galaxy buds pro unfortunately there isn't google assistant support yet at the time of recording this on the buds pro in terms of activating it with your voice through the earbuds if you do want to summon it you can just do your long press and touch commands on the buds but no voice activation like there is with siri on the airpods pro now both of the buds you can also find on a map if you do lose them the airpods pro it is in find my and the galaxy buzz pro it is in the smart things app and you can also use both of these buds independently so for example if you,647.279,621.843,441.27899999999994
CNET,UupKX-NSEOU,Earphone,Competitor,wanted to take a call on one of the earbuds and you could put one back in the case to keep charging that is possible so that is a great feature that both of them share both of these buds also automatically connect to the device that you have them paired with pretty seamlessly the interface does look very similar between the two but anyway both of them have pretty solid connectivity i don't really have any major issues to report there on either of them i would say though that the h1 chip on the airpods pro does seem to be just a little bit more stable overall and the range just anecdotally in my testing does seem to go a little bit further than the buds pro [Music] and finally battery life now the galaxy buds pro do not last as long as some of the previous samsung galaxy buds you might be familiar with like the buds plus which was some sort of crazy number like 11 hours i remember testing them and honestly i just couldn't do enough in my day and wear them long enough to wear them out so you're not going to get anywhere near close to 11 hours with these it is going to be 5 hours maximum with anc turned on that's the samsung quoted number and a little bit more without active noise cancellation unfortunately i didn't quite ever manage to get to that five hours constant listening with active noise cancellation it was more like four and a half at the most so i think i was a little bit disappointed overall with the overall anc claims at least on the buds pro now the airpods pro these ones are rated around four and a half to five hours from apple's official rating and brand new straight out of the box the airport's pro definitely make that claim even though i've had these now for about a year and that battery life overall in terms of the overall stretch i can wear them for has been reduced to around four hours just a little bit under i would say which is fairly standard in terms of normal battery degradation now the cases themselves also hold some extra charge it's 24 hours total in the airport's pro case and also 18 hours on the buds pro and both of the cases wirelessly charge as you would expect and in terms of corded charging it is lightning on the airpods pro and usbc on the buds pro [Music] okay now it comes down to the time where i get to choose a winner and get to decide which one is the best overall earbuds okay as i mentioned at the start i kind of spoiled the video but hopefully if you've made it this far it has actually showed you how similar and how different they both are in terms of things that you might actually want to use them for so if you're looking for something that's the most robust overall earbud for iphone just get the airports pro if you want something that has really good active noise cancellation and you have a samsung galaxy device to get the most out of all those features including that 360 audio and get the buds pro i think overall the one that i would lean towards most is the airpods pro just because the fit is a little bit better for me with those third-party ear tips and also the battery life is a bit more reliable than what i was getting out of the galaxy buds pro but again if i'm on a galaxy device or i'm running android i'm going to choose these for my listening and if i'm on iphone or ios i'm going to choose the airpods pro thanks so much for watching i hope this has been super helpful for you if you want to check out like latest prices or where you can buy these particular earbuds you can find those links in the description below and you can also follow me on your favorite social media platform whether that's tick-tock instagram twitter i'm on everything it's at lexi cevides you can ask me any questions you like about either of these products or any other wireless earbuds or you can leave me a comment down below thanks for watching and see you later,870.399,621.843,455.2020000000002
CNET,Aj8vVJaTgb4,Earphone,Competitor,these are samsung's new galaxy buds pro earbuds they're 200 with active noise canceling and a totally new design with new drivers so how do they stack up against other noise cancelling true wireless earbuds and are they worth upgrading to if you already have the galaxy butts plus let's get right into all that as i said in my earlier launch video these sort of seemed like a cross between the galaxy butts plus and the galaxy buds live and while the earbuds look different from the buzz live the charging case is essentially the same it's nice and compact and has usb-c and wireless charging the buds pro come in three color options phantom black silver and violet and they're fully waterproof with an ipx7 rating it's the highest yet for a set of samsung earbuds i got the black version and the buds did fit my ear securely i was able to run with them without a problem but i gotta say the buds plus fit me a little better overall they just kind of nestle in my ears and they have a little rubber fin that helps lock them into place there's no fin on the buds pro samsung told me that some people felt the buds plus tips probed into their ear canal a little too deeply so it went with this new design that doesn't quite have as deep a fit but the problem is that i couldn't get a really tight seal with any of the included ear tips the nozzles and the tips have an oval shape and for whatever reason i didn't get a tight seal and it really impacted the noise cancelling performance more so than even the sound quality i was like damn the noise cancelling sucks even though samsung says it cancels out up to 99 of external background noise well what i did was i went hunting for some new tips which i happen to have lots of because i,0.24,621.843,204.63800000000003
CNET,Aj8vVJaTgb4,Earphone,Competitor,happen to review a lot of earbuds it seems a little blasphemous to use apple ear tips with a samsung product but i pulled these big yellow tips off the beats flex and stuck them on the buds pro and suddenly the noise cancelling worked a lot better i have a noisy hvac unit in my apartment that blows air and i went from hearing it a little too clearly to having the sound muffled really well basically on par with the noise cancelling of the airpods pro however the noise cancelling isn't as effective as the noise cancelling of the bose quiet comfort earbuds now you may very well get a good fit with the included ear tips my ears a little bit weird so you might do a lot better than i did but i'm just pointing all this out because it's pretty crucial to get a tight seal especially when it comes to noise canceling as far as the sound goes i did lose a little bit of bass without a tight seal but after i switched over to the bass boost mode in the app they sounded just fine and once i went with those big yellow tips i turned off the bass boost to get a more balanced sound samsung told me it's focused a lot on the sound quality and says these have an 11 millimeter woofer for deeper bass and 6.5 millimeter tweeter for richer treble and i did hear the difference in my listening tests and they do sound better than both the buds plus and the buds live the bass is a little deeper and better defined than the bass on the butts plus and the treble does have more sparkle to it the buds plus still sound quite good they just end up coming across as a warmer more forgiving headphone if you compare it to the buds pro i'm not sure these are quite there with some of the very top sounding true wireless buds like the sennheiser momentum true,106.96,621.843,206.72099999999992
CNET,Aj8vVJaTgb4,Earphone,Competitor,wireless 2 and grado gt220 that offer slightly more refined sound but with a tight seal they are among the best sounding true wireless earbuds particularly under 200 and they sound more detailed and dynamic than the airpods pro with punchy bass and relatively open sound they should work well with a variety of music genres and as i said you can tweak the sound in the app a bit though i mainly stuck with the default sound profile [Music] okay let's move on to features along with the active noise cancelling you get an ambient mode that lets you hear the outside world as well as a couple of notable bonus features the first recognizes when you're talking and automatically lowers the volume of your music and fires up ambient mode so you can have a chat with someone it's the same feature that's on sony's wh 1000x mark iv over your noise canceling headphones and it's pretty cool unless you talk out loud yourself a lot or have frequent one-sided conversations with your pets in that case you'll want to turn it off in the app the feature works with all android phones not just samsung's galaxy models but it isn't supported with apple ios devices that's because unlike the galaxy but plus and galaxy buds live these earbuds don't link up with the galaxy buds app for ios though you can stream bluetooth audio just fine from an iphone you just don't get any extra features i should point out something about the ambient mode you can adjust the amount of amplification and with the low setting it sounds more like a transparency mode that lets you hear the outside world in,212.64,621.843,197.54999999999995
CNET,Aj8vVJaTgb4,Earphone,Competitor,a more natural way while the extra high mode really does amp up the amplification and augments little sounds you could touch your your uh shirt here and you would hear it that said the ambient mode even in the low setting doesn't sound as natural as the airpods transparency mode [Music] the other bonus feature is something similar to apple's spatial audio virtual surround feature it's called 360 audio samsung says it features dolby head tracking technology which enables you to stay at the center of the scene when you're watching a movie or tv show i haven't tested it yet because it currently only works with the brand new galaxy s21 models and isn't available yet for legacy samsung smartphones and tablets like the note 10 or tab s6 that i'm using that'll happen down the road with the note 20 probably the next in line for an update for 360 audio and sadly it doesn't work with any non-samsung android devices but as soon as i try it out i'll update my text review on cnet with comparisons to apple spatial audio but apologies for not covering it in depth at this time like with previous galaxy buds there's also a low latency gaming mode and the earbuds will automatically switch between your galaxy devices and automatically pause your music when you take one of them out of your ears or both out of yours for that matter however there's no true multi-point bluetooth pairing for switching between a computer and your phone for example and these don't support the aptx streaming audio codec for people who care about that you can use the left or right earbud independently that means you can use a single bud to make calls or just to listen to audio and not surprisingly the buds pro performed very well in my voice calling tests samsung says,313.12,621.843,213.99999999999994
CNET,Aj8vVJaTgb4,Earphone,Competitor,they have three microphones plus a voice pickup unit that's called a vpu and they're equipped with noise reduction technology that helps eliminate wind noise in particular caller said my voice sounded a touch clearer when i was doing the airpods pro but the noise reduction with these was very good and people said they could hear me well even in fairly noisy environments battery life with noise canceling may seem a bit disappointing to buds plus owners you can get up to five hours of playback at moderate volume levels and up to eight hours with noise cancelling off that noise cancelling number is similar to what you get from other noise canceling butts like the airpods pro but the buds plus are known for having stellar battery life up to around 11 hours [Music] in the end i'd have to say that the best thing about the galaxy buds pro is their sound and call quality their noise canceling is also effective if you get a tight seal they fit me pretty comfortably but as i said the buds plus fit me a little more comfortably if i own the buds plus i'd certainly be tempted to get these because they are a step up in sound quality but after using them for a few days i wouldn't necessarily be racing out to buy them if i already own the buds plus which are a nice value at around 100 or even less online for those who don't have the buds plus or buds live and have been waiting for the bus pro to arrive these are mostly a really good set of true wireless earbuds and they should improve with firmware updates and also come down in price a bit but like the buds live which fits some ears better than others how they fit will ultimately determine just how good you think they are i'm david connor for cnet thanks for watching and let me know your thoughts on the buds pro in the comments section especially if you've used them already take care and stay healthy,420.0,621.843,222.95999999999995
Marques Brownlee,oNCs4C2SMjo,Watch,Apple,okay so here's the thing we already know that these two watches the Apple Watch series 9 and the new Ultra 2 are not for people who already have any somewhat recent Apple watch these are iterative updates for people who don't have any Apple watch yet or have like a really really really really old Apple watch like a series three or something like that so you would really have to squint and and put it side by side with the previous version to actually notice what's different about it versus the previous gen but on top of that some of the stuff that's actually genuinely new with these watches isn't even shipping right away it's coming later this year well later this year you'll see what I mean so I'll make this review really simple for you guys here it's just a spec bump the Apple Watch series 9 is a spec bump over the series 8 and the new Ultra 2 is the same spec bump over the original Ultra basically there's one new color this pink on the series nine that I have and it's pretty similar to the new pink iPhone it's this kind of light salmony colored one aside from that honestly you could never even tell if someone is wearing a new watch matter of fact I've been wearing around this new Ultra 2 for more than a week now nobody's asked about it nobody can tell because it looks exactly the same there were some rumors floating around of heavily speculating on a black Apple Watch 2 you might have seen these also and this seemed like something everybody agreed was probably going to happen and it made a lot of sense because there's always something Apple does just to visually distinguish the new one from the not so new one but what I think happened was Apple got to testing it and then they started to realize just what happens to a coated Titanium on a durable focused item like a watch so kind of similar to the new iPhone there's these new colors with PVD coating on top of titanium for the iPhone 15 Pro but it's a phone so people put it in a case and they're a little bit more careful with it but on an adventure watch where you expect people to run around outside and beat it up and scrape it and drag it through rocks and sand and stuff I think they realized that might have a tough time wearing well so we just didn't get it just looks exactly the same so either way okay what,0.0,621.843,252.83900000000003
Marques Brownlee,oNCs4C2SMjo,Watch,Apple,is the new spec bump uh it's the S9 the new S9 chip inside this phone or the system in package the Sip as they call it literally everything that's new about these watches stems from this S9 so first of all it's a faster chip which just means generally flying around the UI and opening and closing apps and notifications and stuff like that all is technically faster honestly not super noticeable just because you really don't do a ton of that on the watch and the refresh rate is exactly the same but you know what I'll still take it but then it's also a more power efficient chip which you'll always love to see in a small battery Gadget like a watch but Apple actually targets the same 18 hour battery life that they always do and instead cranks the maximum brightness of the new series 9 display up to 2 000 nits thanks to new display driver silicon and on the ultra 2 that now goes from 2000 up to 3 000 nits Max brightness so unsurprisingly they look great outdoors you don't necessarily look at it right away and notice it's brighter it's really only when you put it side by side with the last one that you can at least appreciate how impressive this is 3000 nits is actually the brightest display Apple has ever put in any Gadget they've ever made the S9 package also includes a new Ultra wide band chip that enables Precision finding of your iPhone so basically find my iPhone before on the watch was just pinging a sound to play from your iPhone but now with the watch you can have it direct you to find exactly where your phone is kind of like finding an air tag even more useful if your phone is like in between some couch cushions or something or if it's playing sound echoing in a weird way I think this is a great ecosystem feature I'm sure a lot of people will love it and the S9 package also has twice as much memory built in now and a double the speed neural engine which combined is able to give you faster serial quests and it's able to process all the serial requests on device without any connection to the Internet so Siri's kind of famous at this point for occasion really just grinding to a halt and not answering questions or just taking forever because you have a terrible internet connection so this actually does make a big difference basically asking it normal,125.759,621.843,245.88099999999997
Marques Brownlee,oNCs4C2SMjo,Watch,Apple,questions is pretty consistently quick the on-device Transformer model is also a bit more accurate the Apple wasn't actually specific about which Siri requests are happening completely on device but if we just use our our inferencing here what I understand is happening is basically all the voice processing is happening on device from the S9 and then anything that actually needs to go to the internet to look something up that's when it goes and does the round trip so something like set a timer is always going to be nice and quick no matter what your internet connection is because that's all on device but if you ask it like how tall is the Empire State Building that'll process your voice quickly but then it still needs a decent internet connection to do the rest of it fast it's also supposed to be able to access your health data and be able to submit Health Data from just your voice because it's all on device and local and secure but that's one of the few things that's supposed to be later this year later this year so as of right now when I try the things that were in the keynote I just get non-responses and errors but then the one big feature the one genuinely interesting new thing that stands out to me in this generation of watches as actually Innovative is double tap this double tap feature is like the perfect Symphony of impressive processing power and clever computation and high quality sensors all combined to give you something genuinely new that honestly I don't actually expect other smart watches to be able to copy at least anytime soon so it's just this it's just double tapping your thumb and your pointer finger on the same side that you're wearing your watch to select things on the watch later this year so Apple actually had to ship me a separate watch running I guess an early copy of watch OS 10.1 all the new watches shipping right now I have 10.0 but the feature itself is simple you raised to wake and then you double tap your fingers together to control what's happening on the screen of the watch this is basically most useful in instances where your other hand is full maybe you're carrying something or you're walking a dog or you're cooking and your hand is dirty something like that whatever but when you actually do,249.36,621.843,241.38000000000002
Marques Brownlee,oNCs4C2SMjo,Watch,Apple,it it's basically set up to either select the primary button in whatever app you're in or Advance through the stack of widgets in a series smart stack so basically if you're receiving an incoming call no matter what when you double tap it will accept the call it's the primary button and then when you're in the call another double tap that hits the end call Button because now that's the primary button that's also strangely satisfying in the past for me I know if one hand is busy it's been like a nose tap I know I'm not the only one who's done that so you can't judge me but I'm I'm welcoming of this sort of solution to that problem and honestly it's been very accurate very few false triggers I know that I kind of have to give it a second once I race to wake and then double tap but it's it's consistent it's very good now the whole butt actually thing about this not being new here is there was an accessibility setting called Assistive Touch added I think all the way back with the Apple Watch series 6 which was designed for people who don't have another hand to use their Apple watch so they have to be able to control it with just their one hand and so it had double pinch it had single pinch it had clenching your fist and double clenching your fist for my limited experience because I turned it on and tried it on other watches it works pretty well when you're very deliberate about it but the official reason why this double tap is new and therefore only available on these newest generations of watches and not the older ones is the most Apple thing ever okay ready basically the algorithm that is doing all of the processing from all the data from the sensors which is the same sensors on the old watches is so much more complicated and so much heavier now that it couldn't possibly run on an S8 or an older piece of silicon just the S9 yeah convenient so this is coming this is a in a month thing this is according to the keynote they're usually pretty good about delivering on promises like that but as of right now this is not shipping with the watch either way this is this is something both useful and clearly foreshadowing to the upcoming Apple Vision Pro whose primary gesture will be selecting things by putting your thumb,369.84,621.843,259.723
Marques Brownlee,oNCs4C2SMjo,Watch,Apple,and index finger together honestly it's one of the most fascinating things about this watch but the other fascinating thing is that paired with one of these sport bands the Apple watch is Apple's first fully carbon neutral product like full carbon neutral that that might be the most impressive thing about this entire watch that includes all the materials energy and Emissions used to create it assemble it package it ship it to your door and it accounts for all the energy that it actually takes to run the device for the lifetime of you owning it that is absurd that is extremely impressive I'm kind of taking their word for it on their face I do want to dig more into this later but it's also something that I hope other companies start to copy so here's the thing you know that thing Apple's done in other product categories where they'll have a big silicon upgrade in the same old design as before and then the next Generation they'll actually update the design of the product they've done this with the MacBook Air MacBook Pro other stuff I'm thinking and I'm hoping that to line up with rumors that that's exactly what's happening with the Apple watch this is what we've been wanting for a while look back at it this watch looks basically exactly the same as last year and that one looked just like the year before which looked just like the year before that and the year before that same shape same buttons same fundamentals and I get that if it ain't broke don't fix it that's pretty classic but there's been so many things that we've kind of just been waiting for slash hoping for to maybe see from an Apple Watch someday something like maybe a circular redesign maybe a little more classical shape maybe a rotating bezel like we've seen on the Galaxy watch which is sick maybe an actual Leap Forward in battery life like literally any one of those features would be the biggest update to the Apple watch in years but this ain't it it's just a it's a spec bump now you know thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] 24 7.,501.12,621.843,255.45800000000006
Marques Brownlee,CgJCxnRap00,Watch,Apple,all right one of the great Mysteries of the Apple watch have you guys ever wondered the question is can you get 24 stand hours actually can you get more than 24 sand hours so a stand hour is,0.42,621.843,22.619
Marques Brownlee,CgJCxnRap00,Watch,Apple,pretty simple right you just stand up for 60 seconds out of every hour and your Apple watch can detect that you're standing and give you credit for that stand hour so 24 stand hours is already,11.82,621.843,20.941
Marques Brownlee,CgJCxnRap00,Watch,Apple,going to be really hard theoretically if you fly backwards a few time zones and stand up for every single hour then you will add up to over 24 stand hours in a day so that's exactly what I did so I,21.72,621.843,24.958000000000002
Marques Brownlee,CgJCxnRap00,Watch,Apple,just got on a flight to California which is three hours behind East Coast time and I made sure I was getting those stand hours in yes I did miss one but I stood up every single other hour,34.739,621.843,20.102

Marques Brownlee,HjEqOWjTkHE,Watch,Apple,so on saturday morning i woke up with the apple watch ultra charged up to 100 battery drove to practice i had ultimate frisbee practice out in new york a lot of people don't realize how many calories you burned during a three-hour practice but there you go finished that drove home and then went about the rest of my day i ended that day going to sleep with about 69 battery nice then slept with the watch on for sleep tracking then woke up on sunday morning with 60 drove into new york city again had another practice this one a little hotter sun's baking a little more three more hours and 2 000 calories later that was over drove home went about the rest of my day again and then again i slept with the watch on for sleep tracking woke up on monday morning drove to the studio now it's monday morning 11am at the studio and i currently have 20 battery lift it's pretty good that's two days and two nights and into the third day which is far better than i've ever been able to get out of any other apple watch period but let's rewind for a second [Music] so we knew something like this was coming we knew there was going to be an upgraded ruggedized apple watch in some way and i think a lot of people sort of assumed it would be called the apple watch pro but instead we got this thing and it's called the apple watch ultra the thing is though it would have actually been totally reasonable and probably kind of perfect if they'd also call this the watch pro and that's just because of the way apple treats the word pro nowadays like apples toss the name pro around the highest end versions of almost all of their products iphone pro macbook pro airpods pro ipad pro pro display and each of these expensive devices has some set of features that a smaller fraction of the population can actually take advantage of and use now whether that makes you a pro or a hardcore user or an enthusiast or a wannabe pro like what is a pro airpods user anyway that's a debate for another day but it's the same thing with this apple watch ultra i've been using it for about a week now and the way i think about it is there's a core group of people for which the apple watch se actually covers all their needs and that's like most of the population but then there's an additional group a little bigger than that for which the standard apple watch which is now series 8 covers all of their possible uses so you know it adds the always-on display the different sizes etc it's already a really versatile smartwatch but there's still some people around the outskirts for whom the regular apple watch still wasn't enough and apple naturally still wants those people so this is an 800 watch that has some extra premium features and specs that are amazing and definitely overkill for most people like the ones in the middle of my illustration but it's attractive for the most extreme users the adventurers who go on serious hikes or go diving or run marathons or do triathlons so there's really three main things that they added to this watch over the regular one which are ruggedness features and battery and they all kind of go hand in hand for ruggedness well it's pretty obvious they just beefed,0.0,621.843,396.89799999999997
Marques Brownlee,HjEqOWjTkHE,Watch,Apple,this thing up so it's now much bigger 49 millimeters diagonally but it has the shapes and materials now of a watch that should be much harder to break it's a titanium case with a ceramic back it has much bigger buttons that don't have quite as much travel as i expected but they are easier to press with gloves there's the bigger crown and then the crown guard on the side here it's a very distinct look and then the display at the top here is a flat sapphire crystal instead of the normal curving over the edges with this slightly raised lip all the way around the screen so it's protected from corner impacts to me it's pretty huge like this is a pretty massive watch i will say it is not nearly as heavy as it looks which is pretty nice uh but it does visually stand out for a couple of reasons one this is the only color so this is the exposed titanium it looks very silver i wish it came in black because black is slimming like you can make a black watch look smaller with a black band but that would admittedly require black paint which would probably get like scratched and then the silver would show through and then it would look pretty gnarly after a while so i get it maybe they could anodize it i don't know but yeah big silver watch on skinny wrist looks big but then also two this shape see like this is a big watch to me someone who wears pretty much only smart watches right and smart watches are kind of weird shapes sometimes like it's a computer on the wrist type of a look it's sort of just a block but in the overall watch world the apple watch ultra is actually nowhere near the biggest watch you'll see like some people are very used to much larger watches on their wrists actually and especially those people on the outskirts i was talking about earlier they're fairly used to wearing some of these massive garmins or suuntos or even specialized activity specific equipment like dive computers that'll make the apple watch ultra look compact so the whole like this watch is huge thing is very much up to context but the thing is like a lot of these watches here are bigger than the apple watch but they are watch shaped they're circular up front and then they have this taper around the wrist at the top and the bottom so they don't look like they stick out nearly as much even though they do where the apple watch just doesn't taper at all it's just like a block so yeah the computer on the wrist thing i don't know i actually don't mind the aesthetic like i said i just wish it came in black that would have been nice i wonder if colorware is going to be able to paint these things anyway that's the build quality but the other two things that make the ultra ultra are battery and capability battery being pretty simple it's a much bigger watch and it has room for more battery inside but we'll get to that in a second but the capabilities just come in the form of extra features so the extra microphone and extra speakers for better audio quality in windy environments the dual frequency gps for more accurate and reliable gps and tougher settings like forests or in cities between skyscrapers the wr-100 water resistance rating for submersion,199.76,621.843,364.7199999999999
Marques Brownlee,HjEqOWjTkHE,Watch,Apple,up to a hundred meters the new 2000 nits max brightness for this display which means it's the most visible outdoors that i've seen a smartwatch oled plus it makes for a nice flashlight if you need it and most importantly the new extra button so that bright international orange colored button is called the action button and it can be mapped to right now any one of these eight things so i currently have mine to just open the new workout selector i pick the type of workout and then hit the action button again to get it started and then once you're in an activity there's again a layer of customization to what this action button can do so maybe marking segments or laps inside a track workout or marking when you switch from the bike to the run in a triathlon all kinds of stuff like that i really like having it i did feel like i accidentally pressed it a lot just because of the way i grabbed the watch and adjust the crown but i pretty quickly got used to that too i think the most noticeable thing that this apple watch has over other apple watches is gonna be the battery life so this like i said from the beginning two full days and two full nights with plenty of room to spare that's easily better than it's roughly double what i was able to get out of my apple watch series 7. the thing is while it is a massive improvement for an apple watch it's still nowhere near the other highest end watches which many of them are expected to go weeks months even years without even thinking about charging this one right here this casio watch it's a casio right casio pro trek uh which has solar charging has never been charged it is virtually infinite battery life it didn't even come with a charger in this watch world a two-day battery life is not that impressive but really that that brings me to the ultimate question with this ultra which is how are you going to be using this watch like if you're one of these people on the outside here that doesn't use an apple watch apple was trying to find a reason you didn't use it and add the features or capabilities to make you actually want to use it now because of course they want to bring you into the ecosystem so some of these people over here like these are frequent scuba divers and they've been using dedicated dive computers ranging from giant watch to tablet on the wrist to track depth and directions and a bunch of other safety metrics underwater now the apple watch ultra has added that wr-100 water resistance up to 100 meters there's a new dive app to track some pretty basic stuff like depth and give you times for safety stops on your way back up for recreational diving things like that but then apple also partnered with a third-party company for this oceanic plus app that's coming later this year that seems to do basically everything that the pro dive computers do including air integration pretty much the only thing it doesn't do that some extreme technical divers might want is tank pressure monitoring and depth monitoring past 40 meters now some of these people way over here these people are really adventurous hikers like not the normal beaten path casuals finding popular hikes on google i mean these,382.16,621.843,351.44
Marques Brownlee,HjEqOWjTkHE,Watch,Apple,people are going off and carving their own path for miles and miles in the middle of nowhere sometimes for days at a time so the watch ultra has got now a bunch of navigation related features there's dual frequency gps for more accurate pinpointed gps even in challenging locations but then the new compass app is pretty impressive it lets you set unlimited waypoints so that you can navigate back to them at any time and you can track your exact walking path with a backtrack feature in case visibility is difficult or you need the watch to guide you back where you came from there's also a super loud 86 decibel siren that can play from the new speaker system if you find yourself completely lost with no one around and yes it is actually impressively loud and you can hear it from probably a quarter mile away and there's a new wayfinder watch face by default that sort of puts all the stuff right at your fingertips including a live compass that's super smooth i think a lot of people just leave this face on all the time even if they don't need it but then some of the other people up over here are ultra endurance athletes and of course the name sort of speaks for itself here honestly the apple watch just didn't last long enough for these people's iron man races and ultra marathons and spartan races so the new watch ultras got the dual frequency gps which is huge and the action button is nice too but the significantly improved battery life is huge for these now it's not going to last a week or a year like some of the stop watches or simpler ones do but now it's just about double the battery life of the standard apple watch and it's finally up to the task of some of the most extreme gps heavy endurance athletes and even if it isn't apple has mentioned that there's this battery optimization setting feature coming later this year that it's not the low power mode that's already existed in the watch but it's an extra setting within workouts to ping gps and heart rate less often so in a normal workout for me which is it's a disc sports workout for an ultimate practice basically it's just it's measuring heart rate constantly like every few seconds which is super helpful you can see how quickly you recover you can see when you're in certain heart rate zones during the course of a practice but if you're running like a hundred miles or something ridiculous you don't need multiple pings every minute you just need a broader sense of how it's going so that's a helpful feature for these people and when you turn that on it should essentially triple the life of the apple watch apple says up to 60 hours i don't have it yet because it doesn't exist so i can't tell you exactly how well it does but that's a useful feature they even have a trio of new 99 bands for this watch for these activities so there's a trail band which looks kind of sick then the alpine loop and the ocean band as a reviewer i want to like i want to test all these activities and like go okay i guess i gotta run an ultra marathon now and like scuba dive but i can't remember the last time i was 10 meters underwater let alone 40. so i can't test all of this stuff but,558.24,621.843,348.00000000000006
Marques Brownlee,HjEqOWjTkHE,Watch,Apple,actually reached out and heard directly from these people on my podcast the waveform podcast i'll link the episode specifically below the like button so you can listen to it but i had on a diver an ultra runner and an alpinist so we asked them about the risk computers they currently use and whether or not they think this apple watch ultra is good enough to replace them and through those conversations one by one they each came to the end with basically the same conclusion which is that yeah it looks like they kind of did everything that they were looking for out of an apple watch i'll link it below so you can hear exactly what they said and then there's me so you know i'm a tech reviewer and an ultimate frisbee player so turns out the normal apple watch is actually enough for me like i said a normal ultimate workout or any sort of training we do is typically just a ton of heart rate readings there's not a bunch of gps pings or elevation tracking or anything like that so it's not super demanding but still on the ultra i'd get to reap the benefits of the battery only running down 20 during a practice instead of 40 and then the more accurate gps readings and the brighter screen are kind of nice to have on other activities maybe the occasional bike ride or a hike or stuff like that and it might be better for you too it's one of those things where i think generally if you have to ask you probably don't need it but it really reminds me of the rog phone like that thing is complete complete overkill for almost every human on the planet with all its crazy gaming features and absurdly high-end specs but also all those features for gaming also happen to make it better for media and regular use and it's basically the same thing here like this is technically speaking the best apple watch they've ever made it's got the longest battery life the biggest brightest display the best microphones and speakers and it's all in this most accurate tracking package yet i mean if your wrists are big enough then yeah you can daily this too it's kind of put itself in this unique category where it's replacing some of these extreme like dive computers or gps watches that you'd normally take off when you're done with your workout uh but it's an apple watch through and through at the end of the day you can wear this thing every single day i just don't know if you can like dress this thing down as much as you could a regular apple watch like fun fact i wore the apple watch series seven in midnight with my tux at the met gala and it didn't look insane to me anyway uh get a nice you know watch band with it like the leather one at shopdownitemphd.com it all works out great but yeah this one just because it's so it just sticks out it's massive all the time you can't really hide it as much might have a little more trouble with that but hey if you know what you're getting into the rog phone is a pretty good phone and if you know what you're getting into the apple watch ultra is a pretty good apple watch so that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace,732.24,621.843,361.2779999999999
Marques Brownlee,N8M8OOe3SV4,Watch,Apple,[Music] what's up MKBHD here so by Clockwork Apple just unveiled a bunch of new stuff at their September event iPhone and iPhone accessories my video about the new iPhone 14 series is already live link below that like button go watch it over there if you want a look at those this video is on the iPhone accessories which low-key I think I think were more interesting than the iPhones themselves so first we got the new airpods Pro still 249 dollars like the last ones and still basically the same design but a lot of internal improvements add up to a potentially much better experience so there's new drivers the new H2 chip inside there's two times stronger noise cancellation a new longer six hour battery life on a single charge and touch volume controls on the stocks where the force touch sensors are and there's even a new adaptive transparency mode basically just building on Apple's gigantic lead with their already god-like transparency mode by detecting like extra loud noises and trimming them so so if you walk past the construction zone the mics aren't going to pump in the super loud Jackhammer noises but the best thing honestly is probably the new case I think basically Apple just realized how often people lose the case including myself so it's a lot easier now to not lose it or to find it so there's a hook on the side for Lanyards now plus I added a speaker on the bottom so you can find it when it's lost by emitting a sound and it's all now in a fully magsafe compatible case that can also now charge with an Apple Watch charger the earbud Wars are spicy right now there's a lot of good options out there these are obviously on the pricier end but given how good they sound quality is how good the transparency mode is and how well it works with the iPhone these will probably do pretty well but I'm going to review them I'm going to check them out but what you're really here for is the new Apple watch lineup because that's what I titled the video but that's also the most interesting stuff so that is the new Apple watch SE a new Apple watch series 8 and a new Apple watch Ultra so the Apple watch SE slots in at the bottom of the lineup at 250 bucks to replace the old Watch series 3 that they were still selling and it's better in pretty much every way it's got a redesigned color matching back case a 30 larger screen than that old watch and the S8 sip that makes a lot of sense then the Apple Watch series 8 is in the middle it's a,0.82,621.843,268.98
Marques Brownlee,N8M8OOe3SV4,Watch,Apple,very minor but very reasonable upgrade to the series seven so it's in the same design it gives it a new temperature sensor which is useful for advanced cycle tracking and retrospective ovulation estimates for women it gives it some new GeForce sensors for crash detection so it can automatically tell when you've been in a car crash and it can call for help if you don't respond to the prompt on the screen no idea how I'm going to test that but I believe you and it gives it a new low power mode that can help extend battery life when you're in a pinch boom same price 3.99 for GPS only 4.99 for cellular cool but then there's a new watch at the high end the Apple watch Ultra it basically looks like they uh took a regular Apple watch and sent it to the gym so the result is a beefed up 49 millimeter watch it's the biggest bra brightest display ever in an Apple Watch which can get up to 2 000 nits the display up top is flat and has just just a tiny bit of a lip on the edge to protect the sapphire crystal cover and the digital crown on the side is bigger and thicker with this added Crown guard and a button that sticks out for even normal so it's easier to hit with gloves on then on the other side there's a second speaker and additional microphones added for additional volume and better mic quality and windy environments there's a new button a big bright orange action button this is a customizable button that you can set to do any number of different things like starting a workout or letting up the whole screen white to be a flashlight and then while you're in an app it can serve different functions inside that app and by the way this is the only spec there's only one Apple watch Ultra just this titanium and ceramic they all have cellular and they all have this bright orange action button so you know aesthetically it feels like you know when we first saw these rumors of a pro watch maybe coming they really could only go go two ways they could start with a super ruggedized military-grade Garmin level watch and then try to bring it down and like amplify it or they could start with a regular Apple watch and ruggedize that and they clearly went with option two which makes for this chunky looking Apple watch but still a pretty familiar looking watch what's notable though is it doesn't feel heavy the titanium made it actually feel much lighter on the wrist than I expected so yeah while it's definitely easier to call this one a chunker it's it's thick with maybe three or even four C's just,135.12,621.843,279.8999999999999
Marques Brownlee,N8M8OOe3SV4,Watch,Apple,know it it could have definitely been bigger now there's a bunch of features you know how I think they made this watch I think they they took a bunch of extreme high performance athletes and asked them all how many of you use an Apple Watch and the ones that raised their hand and said I don't use the watch it just can't hang with me they took those people brought them to Apple Park and interrogated them to figure out what they needed to change about the Apple watch to make it keep up with what they do so they for sure talk to some divers who are definitely like yeah this thing is it's waterproof but it's not waterproof enough to go down way as low as I go and be a dive computer and then Apple went and made this watch wr100 water resistant so you can dive down theoretically to 100 meters with it and through extra sensors in there to make it a real proper dive computer for a lot of people I think they talk to Mountaineers who hike in like white out conditions and then from that you get extreme temperature ruggedness you get the ability to add waypoints in the compass app so if you ever need to find your way back someplace that you can't visually see you can always use the watch for it and they tossed in an 86 decibel siren from the new larger speaker which is Extremely Loud and can sort of send out an SOS signal to people nearby and also uh dual band GPS this is a feature you don't see as often as smart watches but can massively improve accuracy and also help out if you're going through some GPS dead zones I think they talked to marathoners who probably all just said yeah the watch dies before the end of a normal Marathon so I can't use it and then of course the ultra now with its new thicker case has room for much more battery how much more exactly well on stage Apple said 36 hours and they also said 18 hours about the normal Apple watch so I'm just doing the mental math of like how long this normally lasts me which is about a day and a half and so the ultra is double so it feels like with normal use it can be about a three day battery and then they also said it could get up to 60 hours with the new battery optimization feature that's not coming till later this year I don't know exactly what that means or what it will entail but if I just do the math again that could net out to about five days of regular use with that mode on but that's that's purely theoretical at this point I definitely have to use it but either way they claim that,275.28,621.843,261.7799999999999
Marques Brownlee,N8M8OOe3SV4,Watch,Apple,marathoner can now not only finish a marathon but they can do an entire Iron Man which is a two and a half mile swim a hundred mile bike ride and a 27 mile marathon back to back and track the whole thing with heart rate and GPS with battery to spare that is impressive so this is definitely living up to the ultra name no question about that and I know when we all see these features we start to think about pricing a little bit so again there were some rumors there were some talks that this might end up being like a thousand dollar watch to start which seemed crazy at first to me but then I had flashbacks of like that ten thousand dollar gold Apple watch Edition so it wasn't entirely out of the aroma possibility but it turns out this one is actually priced entirely reasonably it starts at actually there's only one price One spec but it's 7.99 that's still pricey obviously but that just for context uh Garmin Phoenix a very competitive popular smart watch is 900 bucks uh 800 bucks I think for for the smallest one but Apple's not usually the one doing the undercutting but then on top of that there were also some new faces and bands specifically for this Ultra watch uh the way finder faces are pretty sweet and give just a lot of relevant information to someone who might be in the middle of something like hiking you know there's a compass elevation Etc and then there's three special new watch bands a Trail Loop for endurance athletes the Alpine Loop and The Ocean band for high-speed water sports all of these are pretty unique and actually very impressive both durability wise and comfort wise like these are really good bands and so fun fact I was just kind of wondering and I had to actually check I did take the bands off of the ultra and put them on the smaller watches and they seem to work just fine so just from this experience audience I'm going to say that it seems like backwards compatibility with the bands is a green light so the number one question I've been getting since this announcement is am I gonna get one like okay it's for explorers Adventures endurance athletes a lot of you guys know I play Ultimate Frisbee and I do wear my watch while playing and practicing most of the time so am I in the Target demographic for this uh yes and no I you know they showed a couple obvious examples mountaineering biking Iron Mans and things like that for me like I would love the extra battery life and for certain workouts and things like that,405.96,621.843,280.73999999999995
Marques Brownlee,N8M8OOe3SV4,Watch,Apple,having better GPS and being able to do more workouts before the thing dies would be nice but it's for me like it's still an everyday watch it's an Apple Watch like you still have to wear it all the rest of the time too and for me it is approaching the sort of like too big to be able to pull off normally on the wrist it's not huge obviously I couldn't wear a garment every day either I don't think with my skinny wrists but like fun fact I wore this black Apple watch to the Met Gala and I think it was okay like it turned out fine you can dress it up hide it under a cuff but I don't think you can do all that with the ultra here's how I think of it on the waveform podcast this week Andrew my co-host said I think he explained it kind of perfectly with the summary which is the Apple watch Ultra is like the GoPro of Apple watches you see a cool commercial and you think oh that is sick like this super durable camera is going to capture my Amazing Adventures I'm gonna have the sickest footage ever and then you get one and then you use it maybe once or twice and the footages are right and then it just kind of sits in a drawer Gathering dust and this watch most people don't need but it would be sick like the commercials are sick and I think if you are one of those athletes who I was just talking about in this video like you're definitely going to be able to take advantage of the watch but for most people also the regular Apple watch will be fine and for me it probably will my biggest annoyance with all the watches actually is something that Casey neistat actually just brought up on Twitter which is literally just that if it's if you're sweating a lot or if it's raining or if you've got long sleeves during a workout it tends to mess with the screen it touches the screen even if you have theater mode on it just lights up the screen and messes with the workout Data Tracking I want them to just fix that and I'd be cool with probably any of the watches but for the extreme for the adventurers and for those with Deep Pockets this is going to be a pretty sick watch this is it's very it's competitive with a lot of the other rugged eye smart watches out there but it's key Advantage being it's also an Apple Watch you can also wear it every day and it's also going to work really well with that iPhone that you probably already have so that's what Ultra that's it for the video thanks for watching let me know what you think too if the if the ultra is right for you if you have a certain situation you use it in all right catch you guys later peace [Music],545.88,621.843,290.25800000000004
Marques Brownlee,BsosQkfa2L8,Watch,Apple,[Music] foreign Ty here and this here is an Apple Watch series 7. so if watches did S updates like that this would be a series 6S for sure but they don't either way what you need to know is it's a minor update matter of fact at the risk of tanking this video's watch time watch time uh this watch is basically a series six but with a slightly larger display and slightly faster charging same price that's basically it but there are a bunch of other little quirks and things you should know about it if you're considering actually getting one but yeah like I said the flagship new thing about the Apple Watch series 7 is that it's bigger all right mostly with the screen too so you get this 20 larger display in a watch that's just barely bigger than the previous body and right away you do notice that everywhere the whole UI is a little bigger you know on the calculator the buttons are a little bit bigger and your notifications there's just a little bit more text the map if you're navigating is that much more usable and when you're typing your passcode of course the digits are just that much bigger so for me I like that the snooze button is also slightly larger in the alarm clock but just being slightly bigger with smaller bezels wouldn't be quite enough for a whole new watch so Apple did the apple thing and built a few special features into the series 7 that specifically work best for the larger display so they made two exclusive watch faces for the series 7 only to take advantage of this screen this one here is called Contour where the numbers literally wrap all the way around the very edges and then there's the this modular Duo watch face which basically has two really large data Rich Center complications so I can keep track of exactly how well I'm crushing my fitness competitions all the time then they made a full qwerty keyboard for the watch now that sounds terrible at first and it actually looks a little bit ridiculous on your wrist when you go to reply to a text but it is a swipe keyboard which is easier to crank out,0.0,621.843,244.55899999999994
Marques Brownlee,BsosQkfa2L8,Watch,Apple,words on you're swiping between letters of the words and auto predict is usually pretty decent I just personally didn't find myself actually using this very much like it is enough to get a couple words down but if you get enough words wrong the UI is barely big enough to go back through and select the words you want to replace and then you tap in and then re-swipe them and you're holding your wrist up this whole time and I don't know it's fine it's fine for quick messages but I'm still going to go with voice text nine times out of ten either way I think we all knew that having a slightly bigger screen would be a pretty basic upgrade for a smartwatch but what I was a little more curious about especially after seeing all of those apple promo videos was actually the shape of this new display so if you've seen the videos then you're familiar they've pushed the screen right up all the way to the very edges here and so it gets so close to the edges that apple is showing readable text literally bleeding over the edges and corners of the watch like readable from the side which looks awesome in rendered videos with no Reflections but I was very curious about all the reflections and stray light and refractions that happen in real life turns out it didn't really make much of a difference at all I mean yes the Apple watch has always had this shape with the curved edges and this year the display does push more up into those Corners than ever before but it doesn't make much of a difference with readability where most of the stuff is in the center of the screen literally the one place I found it to make the biggest difference is in the exclusive Contour watch face that puts the numbers all the way around the most reflective edges of the display so then yeah you're going to have to learn to deal with some more annoying Reflections on a regular basis just to see what time it is I like the bigger screen though bottom line now something to consider if you have X smaller wrists or if you're a little more sensitive to the size of this big watch like it's starting to look like a computer on your wrist if you're getting the biggest,131.099,621.843,228.30099999999996
Marques Brownlee,BsosQkfa2L8,Watch,Apple,watch and so you might consider getting this smaller Apple watch instead because that screen size is up to 41 millimeters now which is still very usable that's actually fun fact one millimeter smaller than the original large sized apple watch now when I said there's a couple other small changes I really meant it there's just a couple small things but the thing about small changes is if enough of them apply to you then they can add up to make a bigger change which is nice but if they don't apply to you you might not care you'll probably know pretty quickly which can't be fallen so this is now the most durable Apple watch ever so I noticed the speaker on the left is now a single slot where previous versions were two slots but that's apparently not contributing to durability it's actually the thicker cover glass and you can never tell just by looking at it from the outside because it doesn't protrude anymore it actually goes deeper into the watch and that larger z-axis Dimension makes it more crack resistant than ever before so if you tend to put your wash through a lot maybe you play a lot of sports with it on you're lifting with it you hit stuff with it maybe you're tough on It Outdoors maybe you're my sister and the entire cover glass just breaks off of your watch for no reason then yeah this may be important to you and then the watch is Now ip6x dust resistant not because of some new hardware or coding but actually Apple's never tested the watch for dust resistance before so it's just kind of a bonus to now have that extra Peace of Mind they've always tested for water resistance though like people ask me sometimes if they can get the watch wet or shower with it uh yes you can literally dive underwater with an Apple Watch and it'll be fine it's rated for 50 meters deep of water resistance so it's no Garmin but the things have been pretty tough for a while this watch is also now brighter when you're not looking at it it's subtle but you know so if you have always on you know how it gets dimmer when you're not looking at it and then,244.68,621.843,224.45999999999995
Marques Brownlee,BsosQkfa2L8,Watch,Apple,gets brighter when you're checking it when you're checking it same brightness Max is the same but when you put it down and it's sort of dimmer it's a bit brighter in that dim State than the previous one so if you're someone who likes to just glance over at the watch without doing like an obvious gesture then yeah you can check the time or your complications or notifications easier that way it barely shows on camera but this new watch is slightly slightly more readable from off axis when it's dim it's noticeable when you put them next to each other but it wasn't a huge deal for me but the little thing that applied to me the most it charges 33 faster now so same battery life about a day and a half you can kill it much faster if you do workouts or GPS tracked activity stuff like that but with and only with the new USBC charger included in the box with this new Puck the watch does charge up a bit faster it's not super dramatic it'll still take about an hour to charge it up fully from dead but if you're like me I'm a person that wears a watch like 24 hours a day all the time I sleep in it too so it's my alarm clock I hate going to sleep with it on but it is a great alarm clock just tapping me on the wrist so the only times I really get to charge it are very brief it'll be like when I'm in the shower or when I get up in the morning for a couple minutes so I wanted to charge fast when I do get a chance to charge so this charging speed boost is appreciated uh eight minutes on the new charger is enough for eight hours of sleep tracking with the screen off so that's pretty great just make sure you have a decent USBC power brick and you're set you want to know my biggest disappointment actually with these watches though the color choices so you may have noticed I'm wearing the product Red version of the watch it's very bold bright red but I feel like with a watch you you wear it every day you want it to be a little more neutral a little more able to match with more things and then if you want to spice it up you do that with the watch band like this beautiful new MKBHD leather strap from moment with,357.36,621.843,243.17899999999995
Marques Brownlee,BsosQkfa2L8,Watch,Apple,the full grain soft embossed leather and trademarked parallelogram tessellation pattern and that crisp red accent Link in the description also shout out to a moment for co-designing this but Apple doesn't offer a neutral color for the aluminum Baseline Apple watch I repeat no neutral colored aluminum so aluminum is the Baseline it's 400 bucks and I Define neutral as like a shade of black or gray or white so I know some people might consider the Starlight pretty neutral but it definitely has a warmer Hue than a silver wood and midnight has a slight blue hue much more than a black wood so the only way to get a genuine neutral shade of gray would be to jump to Titanium or stainless steel which is not only heavier but much more expensive so it just bothers me that I can't get a baseline black aluminum Apple watch it's you know maybe I'm being picky about the color but since I am that picky I'll probably just stick with the series six but that's not on sale anymore so if you want to get one good luck so now on Apple's site they're selling the lineup of Series 7 SE and the low end Series 3. so if you can avoid the series three you know unless it's your first smart watch in which case you probably won't know what you're missing that's fine but the main differences between Series 7 and SE are the larger always on display this set of colors of course and there's a couple extra sensors like for blood oxygen and the electrocardiogram the watch SE is great for almost everyone but if you can get past these colors then yeah the series 7 is it's the best overall smart watch for the iPhone still I mean it doesn't have any crazy new features it doesn't have you know charging on the back of the iPhone it doesn't have the new Square redesign we might have been hoping for but yeah it's the Apple watch but bigger there you go but yeah there's a new Apple event literally next week so if you're hoping for some more exciting stuff maybe we'll see some of it there but that's pretty much it for this one catch you guys very soon in the next one because it's techtober and this stuff just keeps rolling catch you guys then peace [Music],478.68,621.843,266.4609999999999
Marques Brownlee,XDamqi_3Aro,Watch,Apple,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here first of all welcome to techtober and i've been wearing this red apple watch series 6 every day since the impressions video now so been living with it i've worked out with it i've slept with it on pretty much everything so this is the full review oh and by the way if you're wondering like hey what about the video about this other thing or where's your video on x or insert review here there's a lot going on right now in the tech world that's why we named them october and september so we're catching up to a lot of it expect a lot of videos in october but okay so summary with this watch is there's really not a whole ton of massively new stuff as you already knew like okay some slightly brighter always on display cool slightly faster charging cool uh and also a slightly new sensor with the blood oxygen but a lot of the stuff that makes the apple watch the apple watch and so good is of course in the software watchos that's gonna make its way to other apple watches but i think one of the biggest mistakes we make in the tech world so often in these mature categories is comparing the new thing to last year's thing when most people buying the new thing aren't upgrading from last year's thing that's actually a pretty rare use case most people have three four-year-old plus versions that are aging by the time they upgrade to this one so yeah surprise if you already have an apple watch series 4 or 5 you don't need to upgrade but if you don't have an apple watch yet well this is the most complete ecosystem bait yet so let's just start with the headlighting new feature which is actually the blood oxygen sensor uh it's not actually the first smartwatch to add this but they did add it now to the apple watch and well it probably shouldn't be your reason to buy this watch now i mean for what it's worth i've been getting pretty decent accurate,0.36,621.843,235.88000000000002
Marques Brownlee,XDamqi_3Aro,Watch,Apple,measurements as far as i can tell you get it pretty snug slide it down your wrist near your hand and sit still for a few seconds anything in the upper 90s is normal and i've i've gotten like 98 to 100 every time i try it sitting down great but if for some reason i stood up or moved around a little bit or for whatever reason i didn't get 98 and i got 88 for some reason which would be a concerning actual measurement i wouldn't really be freaking out at all because lots of people have gotten very inaccurate measurements or just had problems getting a good reliable measure at all but for a little background a dedicated blood oxygen sensor is normally worn on your fingertip just like that i actually learned this while i was working with david blaine on the ascension project uh he needed one to be really accurate to actually tell if he was hypoxic or not which would be dangerous but you clamp it to your finger and it just measures the blood oxygen saturation by shining a light through your fingertip and then reading it on the other side so it's going through your finger now the apple watch is attempting to get the same reading but obviously in a non-ideal place on the back of your wrist so it's shining into your wrist but obviously can't read from the other side so it's trying to read from the reflections and most blood oxygen sensors don't read this way for a reason it's just much more difficult to get an accurate reliable reading from this spot on your body now actually as dave 2d points out in his video you can actually take the apple watch off and put it on your fingertip to get much more consistent readings but yeah if you're doing all that and you care that much about accurate blood oxygen readings you should just grab a 25 pulse oximeter from amazon and it will be way more accurate than any smart watch so yeah this is much more just like a casual extra sensor to give you some new readings in the health app if you want to gamify it and track it uh so if you go for hikes and stuff then cool you get to see oh my blood oxygen's 94 instead of 100,118.88,621.843,243.759
Marques Brownlee,XDamqi_3Aro,Watch,Apple,but you shouldn't be taking it to the doctor um speaking of extra readings in the health app sleep mode so there's sleep tracking built into the apple watch now it is actually a watch os 7 feature again so it's not like it's exclusive to the series six but hey i tested it like i said i've been wearing it every day i've been sleeping in the apple watch because i guess that's the apple effect getting people to try things so when you're about to go to sleep you swipe up control center hit that little bedtime icon and the screen goes black and it starts sleep tracking and really what i found is it doesn't track that much hardcore information like basically it's whether it thinks you're asleep or not heart rate once in a while trends up and down things like that pretty casual but nothing really groundbreaking and people who already have been using third party apple watch apps to track sleep already know way more about their sleep than this will tell you but like i said it's just one more thing that's plugging into the health app and giving you a pretty good basic look at what's going on here so okay it works and that's great and everything but you know what the best part is you know the best part of wearing an apple watch to sleep actually is it's the alarm 100 it's the alarm it just taps you awake just with a little haptic motor no sound or anything and that's been massively underrated i really don't like wearing a thing like this to sleep but the fact that it just taps me awake and i never have an actual alarm sound has been a pretty sweet but also apple i noticed it adds standing hours while i'm asleep so i wake up every day with like two to four standing hours which is kind of odd because i don't know about you but i sleep lying down but the charging question the charging question is interesting now because if you wear the watch all day and then you wear it to sleep when do you charge the thing it does have slightly faster 90 minute zero to 100 charging but when do you actually get it,240.799,621.843,216.4799999999999
Marques Brownlee,XDamqi_3Aro,Watch,Apple,on the charger for me i found two times during the day and neither of them are a full charge but the first one is like right when i like go shower at night but after a workout or something i'll pop it on the charger and that'll juice it up enough to last through the night and then when i wake up in the morning so it taps me awake and i just take it off and put it on the charger and go through my morning routine so it's just sitting on the charger juicing up for the day so it never actually gets to 100 i'm just kind of always bouncing between 20 and 85 which is actually better for battery health on the watch and yeah i never got it to die in a day again so battery life on the watch is still good it's still about what it's been for series four and five and i also do have the always-on display going to me the real best feature of the apple watch series 6 is just the new s6 chip inside like that's what's giving you the great efficiency to last all day that's what's giving you the brighter always on display uh if you disable the oezon display you'll probably get even better battery life and then it's enabling the faster charging that chip is giving you the great performance through watchos 7 which now has faster snappier animations throughout the whole thing which is great oh and also the hand washing detection in watchos 7 is kind of hilarious like it'll pick up that yes i am washing my hands through the microphone and the movement it's sensing and then it'll start some countdown timer based on when it thinks you started and if you get to the end of the 20 seconds great little soapy thumbs up thing but if you don't get to the end of the 20 seconds it just kind of quietly disappears like reminding you to do it better next time the shame but yeah all this stuff pretty minor i think the biggest literally the biggest change most people notice with this new watch is the colors which by the way i'm going to be switching back to my black series 5 because i it does look cool sometimes but i don't need a red watch every single day but also the other new thing they made alongside the new watch is the new,348.639,621.843,229.36100000000002
Marques Brownlee,XDamqi_3Aro,Watch,Apple,solo loop bands and they are a great idea i love the simplicity of just stretching a band to put it on no velcro or magnets or buckles or anything you just put it on get your size right which can be a little finicky but get it snug and it's super clean the only weird thing is they seem to fit the watch a little bit worse than all the other bands like see how it doesn't go quite all the way to the edge of the watch and you can kind of see some of the metal inside instead of it sitting flush with the red of this watch kind of weird if you find that important i personally don't but it's worth noting so you can see it here but you know these are 50 to 100 watch bands order them if you dare so there you have it pretty short list again the thing to keep in mind is they're make they're not making this for people with an apple watch series 5 or even series 4. i think people with a series 3 or older will just have this as the new version to upgrade to around the holiday season conveniently but the truth is most people don't even need this newest version with all the bells and whistles and extra sensors there's also the new apple watch se which has the new s6 chip but hey there's no electrocardiogram and there's no blood oxygen sensor and there's no always on display but it is a much lower price and that's fine for most people getting their first apple watch so if it ain't broke don't fix it and apple absolutely did not fix anything that wasn't broken they didn't change the shape or offer a circular version or anything like that they didn't add qi charging they didn't you know open up a watch face store for third-party watch faces they didn't change anything drastic that wasn't broken with the apple watch so it's series six for 2020 conveniently available for the holidays well played apple and that's pretty much it for the review like i said i'm going back to series five either way that's been it thanks for watching and tech tober rolls on catch you guys very soon in the next one peace,463.28,621.843,234.15999999999994
Marques Brownlee,Mm0NvlXdz4A,Watch,Apple,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and as you probably already know apple held an event this week their usual september event where they only announced two things not an iphone and not an iphone so once we collectively got over that you know it will be a dedicated iphone 12 event likely sometime in october but what we did see at this one was new apple watches and new ipads now it's tech timber so we're gonna get to it all eventually but what i do have here for you is a first look at apple watch series 6 and also we'll touch briefly on the new apple watch se so this is everything that's new and lucky for us it's pretty simple now the new stuff actually starts with the unboxing where you're going to get mostly the same packaging as a previous generation apple watch but this time you'll notice besides the watch itself and the band it comes with half the charger is missing so it comes with the cable that you need but no usb wall adapter and that's now sold separately and apple notably tacked that into the environmental section of their presentation kind of like i predicted in my video about how the iphone 12 will probably also not come with a wall adapter to save money i mean to save the environment from all the e-waste caused by them consider this lack of a brick in the box basically writing on the wall for the next iphone anyway then you get to the watch itself and aesthetically on the outside the only real change that you will notice is the colors and that's because that's the only real change on the outside the materials are the same the sizes available are the same but you do have some new colors now there's blue gold graphite and yes this product red that,0.48,621.843,200.79899999999998
Marques Brownlee,Mm0NvlXdz4A,Watch,Apple,we have here now i personally still like to do my accent colors with the band more than the watch itself i've always had a black apple watch and like i don't think i'd want a red apple watch all the time like every single day but hey maybe you can rock that maybe you can make that choice if you want to some people could i could see wearing the blue like every day it's not so bad but it looks familiar new color that's simple and then on the inside really the tech improvements are the new s6 chip and a couple new sensors so the s6 chip really feels like apple's silicon team continuing to make strides flexing on us again they've always been really good with efficiency and they've made another step in that direction here so it is a dual core chip in here based on the a13 bionic and thanks to an improved efficiency it'll let them crank up the always-on display to be twice as bright as the series 5 and keep the same battery and performance and i've been messing around with this for just a couple hours on watchos 7 and i do think they've tightened up a lot of the animations so it actually feels faster snappier because the animations are shorter but really i think that was the goal is to keep the battery life at a day and a half because that's important that's what it's been for so long and now the watch does sleep tracking so people really need to find the right sliver of time in the morning to charge it up and not have it die and the series 6 watch will actually now charge up faster as well so it'll go from zero to 100 battery in about an hour and a half which is it's not blazing fast for anything but it is an improvement it's better than no improvement at all and of course most things charge their fastest from zero to like 75 percent so that'll be shorter so then those new sensors i mentioned which,101.6,621.843,199.5209999999999
Marques Brownlee,Mm0NvlXdz4A,Watch,Apple,you can kind of see if you're looking at the bottom of the watch or if you fire it up and start to do a new measurement and that's because there is a new blood oxygen sensor so it's literally using infrared photography to measure the color and therefore the percentage of oxygen in your blood it's pretty wild i gave it a shot i consistently get a pretty normal reading which i guess is a good sign now of course the stipulation is it's not medical grade it's just kind of there to inform you generally of where you're at like you probably by yourself won't think this is a reason to get the apple watch series six but it's here and it's cool that it works and then there's some other quick hits five gigahertz wi-fi support now in series six there's also now an altimeter using barometric air pressure to tell you your elevation down to the foot which means it won't work on planes but whatever could be cool for hiking or skydiving or david blaine but yeah that's pretty much it for series six not that dramatic of a difference but whenever you see new colors on apple products people tend to go pretty into it with the color stuff and i can see people making a pretty big deal about that so some of the bigger apple watch changes that i've just kind of been wondering about lately like when are they going to do a different shape like maybe a more round version when are they potentially going to add qi wireless charging support are they ever going to do that to enable more compatibility with other smart wireless charging pads or maybe a future version of air power are they ever going to do truly open third party watch faces and have a whole watch face store none of that big dramatic stuff is happening with series 6. now i do like that watch os 7 keeps slowly adding a,201.2,621.843,188.64000000000001
Marques Brownlee,Mm0NvlXdz4A,Watch,Apple,few more watch faces and there's some more cool ones here again with third-party plugins via complications the way it's always been but again this isn't like dramatically changing anything you still have most of the customization you'd be used to for an apple watch refresh but maybe more interesting than the watch itself actually is these new bands they announced so these these uh these are some stretchy they call them solo loop bands and essentially they're the really clean minimal seamless bands that they've announced alongside the series 6 watch and so basically as you can imagine fitting is really important with these so to get the right one they have a fitting document on their site you can print out use a credit card to make sure you printed the right size then you cut out this loop and use this to wrap it around your wrist to figure out your apple watch size and then you can go in and order your solo loop band in that size and if all goes well then you can attach both ends to the watch and you can put it on just by stretching it over your wrist every time instead of having to do all the hard work of opening and closing a velcro or a buckle i would say just from my experience if you're if you're between sizes i would say go for the more snug one because it'll be a little tighter at first and then you can break it in and eventually get it your size instead of one that's too big and then just always a little bit too big but those bands are going to be 50 to 100 bucks the braided ones here are 100 bucks so i probably wouldn't recommend getting these but the 50 just clean ones that are stretchy and clean i just like stretching them uh pretty minimal and the apple watch series six price is staying the same but speaking of prices,295.52,621.843,186.23999999999998
Marques Brownlee,Mm0NvlXdz4A,Watch,Apple,i also should touch on there is a new apple watch se and that's starting at 279 which is pretty sweet and as you can probably imagine just based on the name the apple watch se is the new old new apple watch that makes sense right but we've seen this formula before basically the apple watch se is an apple watch series 5 more or less there's no blood oxygen sensor there's no electrocardiogram there's no always on display but for a lot of people who don't need most of those things this is a great deal for a watch it's much faster than the series three it has the bigger screen sizes from the new models and it even gets an always-on altimeter so that's a lot of smart watch for 279 i can see this being one of the more popular upgrades or even a gift i think for people this holiday season which is probably a big reason apple's deciding to drop it now but there it is that's pretty much everything you need to know that's different about this apple watch versus the others there's of course the watchout stuff coming to all apple watches there's of course the family sharing stuff which is kind of interesting low-key also appearing across apple watches but hey if you didn't already like apple watch this won't change your mind if you already loved apple watch this won't change your mind you're still going to love it to me i'm still in that mode where i'm thinking about the more nebulous big picture thoughts what are they going to make a circle that type of thing but either way let me know what you think if this is the apple watch for you and uh that's pretty much it tech timber is just gonna keep rolling thanks for watching this one catch you guys the next one peace,388.0,621.843,194.08000000000004
Marques Brownlee,5TuyvWoaAZk,Watch,Apple,[Music] [Music] hey what's up guys mkbhd here i bet i'm not the only one to speak to the ceo of microsoft while wearing an apple watch and i bet i'm not the only one to chat with bill gates with an apple watch on and i bet he's also probably noticed though what is that it's not that i'm trolling nobody doing that is trolling it's just that it's the default at this point the apple watch is everywhere it's the default smartwatch for the iphone which is also everywhere so after a couple of my tweets some of you guys wanted to know my full thoughts on apple watch series 5 the latest and greatest version of it that just came out for this holiday season spoiler alert i've already tweeted most of my thoughts but i'll put them all in one video here in one place so i have the 44 millimeter instead of the 40 for that bigger face bigger battery even though i don't have a huge wrist i think it looks just fine and i went with space gray aluminum so i keep that dark matte finish and i've had no durability issues on my other aluminum apple watches and yes just to get it out the way i do wear it on my right wrist even though i'm a righty i guess i'm just backwards like that so if you remember that apple event just a couple weeks ago there weren't really all that many new features with the new apple watch you know there's a new brushed titanium finish that looks really cool and there's also the other ceramics and stainless steel and things like that and there's some other new features and some new bands but really the main new feature of apple watch series 5 is the always on display so technically,0.0,621.843,178.98899999999998
Marques Brownlee,5TuyvWoaAZk,Watch,Apple,speaking this new apple watch is able to maintain the always on display with a new display technology that keeps it lit up dimly but lit up all the time at a variable refresh rate so it's called ltpo which stands for low temperature polysilicon and oxide which doesn't really matter as much as just knowing that this involves a special controller and certain hardware that's only in apple watch series 5. so there can't be a software update to make the series 3 or series 4 do always on it's just in series 5. so the display itself it'll look just as good and it'll get just as bright and it's just the familiar oled you're used to looking at but now it's always on so typically when you're using an apple watch the oled refreshes at 60 frames per second 60 hertz that's why animations are smooth everything looks normal and a secondhand if you have one on your clock face sort of smoothly rolls around in a circle this is still the case here with this new version but when you stop using it or you put it down it goes into always on mode the display dims and it ratchets down to refresh as low as 1 hertz or one time every second which is fine because it hides the second hand and it doesn't have to show you constantly refreshing information and things smoothly on the screen so it can still show you the time all the time and save a ton of power by not still refreshing at 60 hertz so okay what are the benefits of this always on display you may ask if you've never used any other smartwatch well if you've had an apple watch before then you're already used to this gesture you have to do to get it to recognize that you're looking at it and to light up whatever your latest notification is or to just,97.04,621.843,190.88
Marques Brownlee,5TuyvWoaAZk,Watch,Apple,see the time sometimes you can get pretty good at it doing it subtly but it's a pretty obvious gesture but of course sometimes it's just kind of hard or just straight up inconvenient to do that whole gesture and you just want to be able to glance over at it and see the time or just check something real quick without the whole obvious wrist movement maybe you're driving or riding a bike and don't want to switch to one hand or maybe you're typing and you just want to look down and glance at the time without stopping or maybe you're in just a social situation or it'd be kind of rude to check the time with the huge sweeping gesture so these are all real situations and that is why people wanted always on just the glanceability but the most controversial trade-off here with always-on is battery life so apple claims that the variable refresh rate is what will help you not obliterate your battery life it's going down to this way low power mode and it's true it doesn't completely crush your battery but i have definitely noticed that having the always on display always on does hurt your battery life i personally went from ending the day with 50 something percent left to ending a normal day with 20 to 30 left and that's not the end of the world that's definitely still clearly all day battery life for my usage which is high brightness getting plenty of notifications frequent workouts things like that but i did still notice that hit and on a day with a longer outdoor workout where it's using gps and it's just always on you can actually get close to killing the apple watch in a,192.48,621.843,178.401
Marques Brownlee,5TuyvWoaAZk,Watch,Apple,day which i never did before always on and i did some more on and off testing with this and some of you were actually skeptical about it when i tweeted about it saying it was the noise app in the background or some other things with software that i should check out but i don't need any more proof than the fact that when i turned it off i was getting to noon with 90 plus percent battery life left which is incredible and that's that's legitimately two day battery life that i wasn't getting when i turned always on back on so that's something i've noticed at this point i kind of just turn it on when i want to and then turn it off when i know i'm going to be having a longer day it's only a quick couple taps away in the settings i switch wrists sometimes so i'm used to diving in the settings to change the wrist orientation so i just do that often i'll just turn always on off sometimes so if i'm out at night i'll usually turn it off because it's slightly annoying to be the guy with the glowing wrist all night but in a normal day at work during the day i'll leave it on it's a balancing act it's a little more thinking than i had to do before but it's also a feature i've never had before so i guess i'm willing to do that some other small thoughts the compass built in now is pretty sweet i will literally never use the compass app but it is cool that it's more accurate to tell you what direction you're facing when you're using maps and the noise app is also kind of cool you can add a complication to your watch face or just use the app to monitor noise levels and it'll tell you when the,280.96,621.843,165.59900000000002
Marques Brownlee,5TuyvWoaAZk,Watch,Apple,environment you're in has potentially damaging levels of noise and just the thought about the blob app chooser interface i just gotta say i think this might be the worst ui in any apple product in any tech product in like the last decade i think we can all agree on that um i've changed it to list mode maybe uh maybe figure out a grid mode or something for picking apps on the watch apple just saying but overall honestly it's it's kind of similar to that iphone 11 review where like it's an apple watch like you already know what it does it's the same design some subtle tweaks and really one main new feature i think uh the fact that i've disabled the always-on display so often is kind of hilarious like if you would disable it if you wouldn't use the oezon stuff very often then this is about as good as a series three or series four in which case you can pick one of those up from apple or on amazon for a pretty steep discount so i'll link those below that's a better deal but other than that i just kind of like the way the apple watch has been it's not a necessary upgrade but for the stuff i usually do which is having the great display telling the time workouts notifications that's just basically it i mean anything extra is a bonus apple watch continues to firmly deliver on all the things you expect it to um and if you've always wanted always on then this is the apple watch to get but anyway that's about it quick review but if you want the next stuff it's coming up quick it's tectober there's a lot happening i'll catch you guys in the next one peace,364.479,621.843,180.239
Marques Brownlee,naIaW4pk_-o,Watch,Apple,[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and i've always carried an iphone with me as you guys already know but i've never been much of a watch person like i've gone on and off with a bunch of different smart watches over the years that i've tried the original moto 360 previous generations of apple watch even the new samsung galaxy watch that just came out but always on and off with them i've never been consistent with it this one looks like it might be changing that this is debatably the best thing apple announced at that latest event the biggest upgrade for sure and while i was there i spent all my time with the phones but now i've gotten to spend a lot of time with the watches over the past couple days and i gotta say it's about time we got something like this [Music] so series four is the first real redesign of the apple watch and it's massively better in a lot of ways more powerful more modern more functional and just more fun it comes in two new sizes the previous small 38 millimeter has turned into a 40 mil and the large 42 millimeter has turned into a 44 mil so i'm rocking the new larger one in space gray aluminum and it's low key way nicer than the series 3. now naturally when you hear it's bigger you'd be concerned about the watch being too big on your wrist but basically the actual size of the watch itself is nearly the same like a couple fractions of a millimeter taller and a bit wider but on the wrist you don't notice it's like if you like the old size you'll like the new size but thanks to the bezels shrinking so much you get a way bigger screen a 30 bigger screen area in the same size body no notch needed that is huge every smartwatch deals with bezels in some way and this is a great way to do it it also does have rounded corners which i'm not as big of a fan of but it matches the shape of the watch now and overall it's a less bulgy thinner more modern looking piece it's a bit thinner in that sensor area on the back too and all the changes put together make every previous apple,1.61,621.843,249.19900000000004
Marques Brownlee,naIaW4pk_-o,Watch,Apple,watch look terrible in comparison this is the first apple watch that to me actually looks pretty sleek there are some other minor cosmetic changes too this is the lte connected watch and that huge red dot of paint from the last gen has turned into a more subtle red ring the sensor array on the back even they don't necessarily look at it that much is now ceramic and looks way better the mic has moved from one side to the other so it's further from the speaker that's functionally better and the speaker is now made way bigger but overall it's still a familiar apple watch shape and and the bands from the previous years are all still compatible with this new one and using the watch software is now the same but better meaning it's now watchos 5 which all apple watchers are getting now and functionally it's the same it doesn't do anything different it's still the bubbly app launcher all that stuff hasn't changed but it's now better so it's on this larger display already and then they've made all the buttons bigger and easier to press and all the fonts and texts larger and easier to read so it just makes the working surface area of the watch so much bigger on your wrist to the point where it's actually not a horrible thing to pull out maps or open photos up on the watch you can actually kind of see stuff now if someone sends you a link in imessage and you open it on the watch you might not hate trying to read it and apple's showing off these huge new displays the best way they can with some new watch faces that happen to look super good on an oled display of course with these inky blacks but there's a lot of that by design there's the infograph watch face that you've seen like in the ads and all this new promo material it has a ton of complications in all four corners and then four more in the middle plus an hour and a minute hand and it's just a ton of information i happen to like it a lot it's the one i've been using some people absolutely hate it it's like a crime against design by the amount of colors people see it's kind of meant to emulate those super high-end watches with tons of,127.439,621.843,220.16099999999994
Marques Brownlee,naIaW4pk_-o,Watch,Apple,visible mechanical parts but a sort of a more digital and more colorful version i got the temperature in one corner my battery in another the uv index outside i don't check that or care about that and my activity rings i don't know it just kind of looks cool i like it i don't know why you can definitely tune it down though and there's also now a new infograph modular face that's a more digital version that still has a lot of complications with a similar gradient color style to each their own there's also a new vapor watch face and a fire watch face and a water one and these were all made this is this is the part that the video nerd in me absolutely loves these were all made using practical effects and recorded with an actual camera so they actually made a giant apple watch sized bin of metal with a camera over it and filled it with fire and recorded it fun fact and probably the most gratuitous apple thing ever i love it so the bigger screen and the new design i'd say those are the main draw the biggest reasons to get this new watch but then i'd say there are two other reasons one the new specs it's a bit faster which helps the s4 chip helps swiping through the ui which you don't do nearly as often as you do on your phone but it used to be painful on the watch so i'm grateful that they focused on making it smooth now switching between watch faces adjusting complications scrolling launching apps all that and launching siri is actually noticeably faster and getting responses from her is snappy there's also now just ways to talk so you can raise the watch up and immediately just start talking and it'll quickly hopefully answer your question if you're asking one so how tall is the empire state building empire state building is 1250 feet tall when it doesn't work though it kind of just looks like you checked the time and then just started blurting out words which is probably not the best look so i definitely still prefer like holding down the watch crown and and holding and talking and letting go even though it takes an extra hand and an extra second so uh how many feet is 100 meters the answer is,237.2,621.843,235.56
Marques Brownlee,naIaW4pk_-o,Watch,Apple,328.08 feet that's fast and you could probably also just hear then the speaker is actually a lot louder uh the big slot on the side i'd say it's significant so if you're one of those people that makes a lot of phone calls on the watch or like gets a lot of responses from siri or is just talking to it a lot or even does walkie-talkies then that that louder speaker will matter which brings us to your final reason you might want to get this watch and that's just the sprinkling of new features apple tossed in here and there like the new walkie-talkie mode is maybe the most gimmicky thing ever but in case you want to talk to people on your watch but don't want to call them there is a walkie-talkie mode that you can enable that lets you push to talk over and with that throwback to nextel in the 90s i think that falls in the bucket of old people are gonna love this features alongside fall detection and ekgs fall detection is exactly what it sounds like so it is after all an accelerometer and a gyroscope on your wrist so apple tuned this and studied a lot of people falling and with that if you take a hard fall and then don't move for a while it will automatically call emergency services and notify your emergency contact which is actually pretty smart and i'd say an apple watch for someone is way cooler than the pendant of shame you normally see for fall detection i've fallen and i can't get up but also construction workers and painters and many other people who work at heights will love this too of course and the ekg feature is actually extremely impressive it's not enabled yet but when it is you'll be able to just hold down the watch crown and it'll connect the circuit and the watch can accurately read your heart and produce an ekg that you can then export as a pdf and send directly to your doctor and it'll detect things like irregular heart rhythm afib this is a feature that when it's available could legitimately save lives so the new apple watch has a lot of things going for it but it's not all great uh there's definitely it's still very apple in a couple frustrating ways meaning there are some things that they could,355.16,621.843,230.599
Marques Brownlee,naIaW4pk_-o,Watch,Apple,definitely do with it that would clearly make it better that they just don't do there there is no sleep tracking at all which you would think would be kind of a big deal in a watch that's so focused on health and fitness but it's not there there's also still no completely custom watch faces just the customization of the ones apple made now to be fair apple's made a lot at this point but i feel like if apple opened this up to developers and had an app store for watch faces it could be huge right you still can't use any assistant other than siri of course i'm not surprised by that but if i could switch it to google assistant i would be so happy there's also no always-on mode that i think they could totally do with this battery life and these oled displays it is as consistent as ever with the whole raise to wake thing but a lot of people i've talked to want it to look more like a normal watch even when you're not using it and part of that would just be showing a watch face all the time now that would definitely bring battery life down but it's already two to three days that i get now so it'd bring it down to maybe one day and that's not the end of the world i think it would be fair to give that as an option but at the end of the day this is the best smart watch by far all over again and obviously the one to get if you have an iphone it's the best productivity watch the best for notifications and responses to them the best fitness watch the best health tool on your wrist now the price ranges a lot based on what size what material and then whether you go with lte or not ranging from 399 all the way up to like you could spend eight 900 bucks on this thing i wouldn't recommend that but yeah overall i just feel like i've always been in this weird place where i know i carry an iphone and i've always been a fan of the apple watch but i never feel like i'm missing out on anything when i just don't have one but this one i'm gonna keep on me i'm pretty sure biggest upgrade to the apple watch yet and i love it and i think if you're looking for an apple watch you will too thumbs up for me until the next one thanks for watching catch you later peace,470.479,621.843,225.84100000000007
Marques Brownlee,N3NPXB3eiPY,Watch,Apple,hey what is up guys I'm QB HD here and welcome to my hotel room in San Francisco California and I'm here because I'm actually going to be going to Google i/o which is just a couple of days away it's right around the corner around the corner literally but I'm not doing a video about Google today I'm actually doing a video about Apple today so when you're out and about traveling or even just wearing the Apple watch in general no matter how much you cover it up or no matter how much you don't show it to anyone people when they figure out that you're wearing an Apple watch inevitably have a lot of questions about it even if you're wearing some other SmartWatch they ask about the Apple watch so I have sort of compiled a list of the ten most frequently asked questions that people have when they figure out that they're interested in the Apple watch number one what are the best apps for the Apple watch and this could easily be its own entire separate video but for now so my favorites right now are Shazam which just lets me ID a song with one tab on the watch and deliveries which is another favorite it's another one of those things that I've gotten used to on Android we're getting a notification when a package gets delivered and then actually some first party one so I really like maps the turn-by-turn directions function and the activity tracker is very good if you're a fitness person the Apple watch sport combined with the fitness tracker is really good and then of course there's things you know like Instagram and Twitter but the,3.14,621.843,146.67999999999998
Marques Brownlee,N3NPXB3eiPY,Watch,Apple,thing is these aren't really Apple watch apps essentially they're iPhone apps that happen to have an Apple watch component to them so number two what's the deal with these Apple watch apps and why are they so slow here's the thing Apple watch apps are not native what this means is the components the resources for the apps are not actually stored on the watch they're stored on your iPhone and when you tap to open that app on your watch it streams and moves all those resources to the watch for you to open so that's why it can be a little bit delayed a little bit slow and can feel like it's lagging a lot and you can store up to about 20 megabytes of image resources on the watch for a particular app but bottom line is they're not native and that's why they're slow fortunately there's a fix for that thanks to the Apple watch gate framework native Apple watch apps are coming next year should it have been that way to begin with probably but at least they're getting better number three is it waterproof no but it is rated for ipx7 water resistance and essentially this is just a precautionary measure it means you can go out in the rain and wear it outside and it's not a big deal if it gets splashed but I there's been videos on YouTube of it getting you know water poured on it and being submerged and even people taking showers with it I wouldn't recommend those things even though it technically survived but yeah it's water resistant to a degree for how is the battery life really it's actually pretty good,76.83,621.843,151.77
Marques Brownlee,N3NPXB3eiPY,Watch,Apple,in the hierarchy of modern smartwatches that not including pebble the Apple watch is pretty much up there it's I've said in the full review it lasts about a day and a half on battery I've never killed it in a single day and I've gotten pretty close to two days pretty frequently and I've also got to test the power reserve mode when I was traveling today got on my flight put on power reserve mode at about 97% six hours later the flight was over and I check it and I turn it back on and it's still at 97 percent so that was great it charges in about an hour and a half to two hours from empty and it does get a little bit warm while charging but that's not a big deal and you can also get a little bit of extra battery out of your iPhone if you don't check it as much since you're using your watch number five does it scratch yes it kind of does I have a stainless steel version and I have like one or two tiny hairline scratches on it not a big deal my moto 360 also has a couple of tiny hairline scratches on it so that's not a big deal that's just the way they are so number six what kind of accessories are there for the Apple watch it's an Apple product surely there's going to be accessories and yes there are there's a whole bunch first of all there are some docs for it and these are sort of alternative methods for charging it since Apple's method isn't exactly pretty you can get sort of a larger more pretty version of a doc to charge your Apple watch those I understand actually the gold Apple watch Edition even comes with its own custom charging case then there are screen,152.55,621.843,148.76900000000003
Marques Brownlee,N3NPXB3eiPY,Watch,Apple,protectors which I guess also makes sense you want to keep it in pretty decent condition you want to avoid those scratches and force touch still works everything still works with the screen protectors on so that's fine and then there are cases for the Apple watch you don't need a case for the Apple watch number seven is it true that there is a mystery port on the Apple watch actually yes there is there's a sort of a tiny port a diagnostic port right behind where the band clips in where it actually does accept power so people are sort of trying to come up with bright ideas to take advantage of this one company is actually building a new Apple watch band with a battery built into it to plug into that little tiny port sort of a bright idea I'll leave a link to that right below of that like button if you want to check it out and yeah that's sort of the idea it's mostly still for Apple employees to troubleshoot the watch number eight what's good with force touch actually force touch is really good especially in the Apple watch mostly because the vibration motor and the watch is so good but it's sort of a more info button and it's gotten pretty useful in the Apple watch my favorite thing about it is just long pressing on your notifications to clear all notifications that's something that I wish would come to Android wear maybe we'll see that at Google i/o in a couple of days but it's here to stay it's in the new MacBook it's on the new Apple watch and actually it's expected to show up in the next iPhone as well so force touch it works and it's pretty,227.22,621.843,153.02
Marques Brownlee,N3NPXB3eiPY,Watch,Apple,good even though it has a terrible name number nine what is the best combination of band / size for the Apple watch really it's all personal preference you're just choosing a bunch of materials for it my personal favorite would be the 42 millimeter Space Gray stainless steel with the leather loop I actually think that leather loop looks pretty badass so that brings us number 10 which is should you buy the Apple watch and a lot of people's gut response is either a heck no or maybe yes if you own an iPhone and you want a smart watch the Apple watch and the pebble are really your only choices and at 349 bucks there are other smart watches at this price and for the build the Apple watch sport is at least worth that price anything above the Apple watch sport the functionality is exactly the same and you're only paying for a difference in materials they're paying for a leather or Milanese band or stainless steel or sapphire crystal those kinds of things the craftsmanship is fine on the Apple watch sport and if you can deal with that I'd say yes but if you're going to go above that really think about exactly what materials are getting and if you think spending five seven eight hundred dollars or ten thousand dollars is worth it on an Apple watch I would lean towards no but if you're going to just get into this for the first time Apple watch sport is fine there you go guys hope you enjoyed this video thank you for watching and if you found it helpful at all definitely share it for other people who have questions about the Apple watch hopefully this will answer theirs as well again thanks for watching and see you at Google i/o talk to you the next one pace you,303.34,621.843,178.29100000000003
Marques Brownlee,Ks_7TmGNZI4,Watch,Google,so the first pixel watch was bad but you can't skip the first gen you just kind of have to give it your best shot and then what you learn you put into the second gen and that's when we really judge you and so even though it looks,0.0,621.843,18.599000000000004
Marques Brownlee,Ks_7TmGNZI4,Watch,Google,almost exactly the same my hot take is that the pixel Watch 2 is actually good now so they gave it an updated quad core processor which yeah makes it a bit zippier around the user interface but more importantly it's more efficient and,9.36,621.843,24.441
Marques Brownlee,Ks_7TmGNZI4,Watch,Google,substantially improves battery life so I'm now getting over 24 hours per charge with the oon display on by default it also charges much faster and on the back you've gone from one to five heart rate sensors so that's for much better heart,21.72,621.843,23.840000000000003
Marques Brownlee,Ks_7TmGNZI4,Watch,Google,rate detection during heavy activity so I did a workout with both the Apple watch Ultra and the pixel Watch 2 on at the same time and on the pixel watch you literally get a new heart rate reading every second which is super helpful for,33.6,621.843,20.718999999999998
Marques Brownlee,Ks_7TmGNZI4,Watch,Google,stuff like hit workouts when you need to wait till your heart rate drops to a certain number before starting the next thing it's so much better the only real downside being that it uses a different charger from last year so it's incompatible with that but it's got the same Sleek design and the same price not bad anymore,44.2,621.843,30.721000000000004
Marques Brownlee,-OpUg0GDrII,Watch,Google,24 7. ah [Music] 24 7. let's talk about this Google pixel watch so the first generation of any uh new piece of tech is always interesting you know this is Google's first pixel Smart Watch we have the Google pixel phones and the pixel Buds and the pixel tablet coming later that could be fun too but yeah this is their first crack at a pixel Smart Watch so I know I'm not the only one who was very curious just waiting for this thing to see what it would look like what features they would include how well it would work together what the design would be and I also know that I'm not the only one who's disappointed in a lot of this stuff let's talk about it so when you first buy a pixel watch for 350 you get a small 41 millimeter circular smart watch it comes in this one size but there's three colors black silver or gold the black being the best in my opinion because it is matte black while the other two are very much glossy and the front glass curves way over into a dome shape made of Gorilla Glass 5. it's like a Sleek little Pebble well not a Pebble Smartwatch but a literal Pebble a very lightweight weight Pebble and there's only two buttons the crown that rotates and pushes in and then a button right above it the crown I think is really good it sticks out enough it's usable everywhere it has haptics when you scroll with it nice and clicky the button above it not so much it's pretty small doesn't have much travel it's still clicky but because of the domed glass it's pushed fairly far back kind of close to your wrist luckily you don't really use it that much and then connecting the watch bands at the top and bottom happens through this clever little push and slide system it's clever I say because it can connect bands in this really seamless looking way without any lugs or bulky connections and the first party watch bands do a really good job of looking like they just jut out of the side of the watch which is pretty cool you might not care about this at all if you never change watch bands but as somebody who changes watch bands every single day to sleep in a different band I just get used to this motion a lot and so I find it good when it's good and this is also something very important to get right in the first generation because you don't really want to have to change it three years in because that makes everyone's watch bands that they just bought for the past three years incompatible so they're trying to keep this for a long time so Hardware wise I think this thing is actually pretty beautiful I love the simple Circle you can easily dress it down and keep it subtle or you can just go sports band or fabric band it seems to fit right into a lot of different,0.78,621.843,279.19000000000017
Marques Brownlee,-OpUg0GDrII,Watch,Google,places it's stainless steel it's water resistant up to 50 meters and the back happens to be pretty simple too it's just a heart rate sensor blood oxygen sensor and the ECG and up front this is a thousand nit OLED display with a mostly black background through most of the software so it just kind of feels like a black disc floating on your wrist it's nice the only thing I wish is that it was bigger or if there was a larger version so I don't even have that big of a wrist but this thing is just it's pretty small which some people will like but I just wish I had a larger screen this watch is a 41 millimeter watch but that measurement is just of the actual outside of the casing when you actually get a look at this thing the bezels are pretty substantial and so the screen is down to about 29 millimeters across now I don't actually hate these bezels I think it's it's kind of like the notch on a phone you know a lot of people who don't actually use it can make a big deal about it because if you just look at them they look silly but the mostly black background throughout the UI does a good job of hiding them and you really only see them when you're looking for them or if you set a photo as a watch face but I really think a bigger watch would feel even more modern for the computer on the wrist nerds like me and it would also solve the number one problem of this Hardware which is battery life because the battery life is trash it's bad it's it's just not good at all so on stage Google said what did they say up to 24 hours was their claim which probably should have been the first red flag because if you think about it 24 hours is like 8 A.M one day to 8 A.M the next day so one day and one night but that's the maximum it's up to 24 hours so the always-on display is off by default out of the box I turned that on and it's literally measuring your heart rate every single second all day every day every single second that's a lot of heart rate measurements so just for context the Apple watch for example is checking periodically through the day and every five seconds while you're sleeping so now here I'm getting more like 18 hours tops which is not quite enough to go all day and then do a full night of sleep tracking so if you wanted to sleep tracking like me basically you have to charge it twice a day every day sometime in the morning when you wake up and then again sometime in the afternoon before you go to sleep or it's just gonna die if the thing drains about 20 to 25 battery just during one night of sleep tracking now measuring your heart rate every single second to the second is actually kind of sick like it's pretty cool there is a complication they showed it on stage two of just the watch telling you every second updating what,140.94,621.843,311.8199999999999
Marques Brownlee,-OpUg0GDrII,Watch,Google,your heart rate is like I've never seen anything like it it's the most accurate heart rate tracking I've ever tried in a wearable it's great for tracking workouts heart rate recovery you know this this is the Fitbit prowess going to work no doubt but the other smart watches that are now years in you know the Samsung Galaxy watch 5 and the Apple Watch series 8. they've all realized by this point that the way you save battery is by pinging all these sensors less often like the battery saver mode on the new Apple watch literally is just pinging heart rate and GPS less and turning off things like the always on display and the blood oxygen readings that are going on all the time in the background that's how you save battery so the fact that this watch does it all the time can be cool but also can nuke your battery all the time when I go to bedtime mode and just turn on like the sleep mode it doesn't say it's stopping those heart rate measurements it continues to measure my heart rate constantly I will say though the Saving Grace that makes it usable is that it does charge up very fast it does come with this plastic Puck charger in the box with a pretty weak magnet that feels like it could easily fall off also very first gen feeling but it could go from like 10 to 40 percent in like 15 minutes which is amazing and it can go from zero to a hundred in about an hour but okay all that being said the most clumsy thing about the pixel watch for sure is the fact that it's also a Fitbit or let me rephrase that Fitbit isn't built into the watch so much as it's like bolted on to the side so wear OS 3.5 here is it's fine it's pretty familiar it's still intuitive you've got your watch face with a swipe down to get to all your customizable Quick Settings that's nice and then you swipe up to get to your notifications your list of apps is one click of the crown away but your recent apps is behind that secondary button that I find I almost never use then you can swipe sideways between a predetermined set of tiles that you can organize in the phone app and these are like these big quick shortcuts to screens that you might use a lot ongoing background things will show up at the bottom so if you have a notification there's a little dot for your notification dot if there's a music playing it'll show a little animation for that and if you're in the middle of something like a workout and a new notification comes in it'll show the logo down there for that too so to control any of the normal watch faces and complications which I really like a lot of them you go through the Watch app makes perfect sense but then for the fitness stuff that's where Fitbit which Google acquired in 2019 comes into play,297.06,621.843,302.34
Marques Brownlee,-OpUg0GDrII,Watch,Google,so when you set up the watch you actually make a Fitbit account and it starts you off with 6 free of Fitbit premium which is a subscription service so as a smart watch I've mostly enjoyed using it's been fine like it's smooth it has a good performance but it does feel disjointed sometimes in ways where like you'd expect it to sync more things with the phone but it doesn't like for example when I put my pixel phone my pixel phone in Do Not Disturb mode the watch does not go to do not disturb mode it keeps buzzing it has its own separate Do Not Disturb mode basic stuff like it feels like it should work together more than just being a Bluetooth accessory connected to your phone but then you do a bunch of Fitness stuff a bunch of workouts or whatever sleep tracking and then the watch dumps all of that Fitness data into the Fitbit app now there is still a Google Fit app by the way the watch doesn't really talk to it at all so what does that mean for the future of the Google Fit app I don't know your phone can still talk to it and dump like step counting in there but then you're using two different apps to track Fitness so I I don't know and then even throughout the watch UI all the Fitbit stuff it's in there but it also it kind of just feels like they just dropped it in there on top like instead of ECG it's Fitbit ECG and a set of exercise it's Fitbit exercise and then you start using these features and the free six month trial before you realize a ton of the stuff it's collecting and that you're using like the breathing rate heart rate variation sleep stage tracking and sleep scores all of that goes behind a Fitbit 10 a month subscription paywall when the free trial is over it feels like you can see the Arc of the thinking where like Google wanted people to use a Google watch so they bought Fitbit and then as I integrated it they realized oh people love the Fitbit name and they still want a Fitbit so you can't remove that name or that branding so people now get the Google watch that has Fitbit in it and they use the Fitbit app but then there's also Google fit in the background that they hopefully also choose to use sometimes and they all don't really talk to each other now all this stuff you know it doesn't make the rest of the parts of the watch worst use it all still works it's just it adds to this first gen feeling here where you can tell that there is a lot that can get better and this is the funny thing about reviewing products that you're like hoping to be good you end up sounding really harsh like a disappointed parent or something basically I think this whole pixel watch thing has a lot of potential and I really do enjoy parts of it having Google assistant on my wrist everywhere,447.96,621.843,301.13999999999993
Marques Brownlee,-OpUg0GDrII,Watch,Google,is awesome downloading music to stream offline the turn-by-turn navigation with maps The Voice to Text to respond to Notifications all that is great but they clearly still have some first gen learnings to do like the the charger the heart rate monitoring that is constant that doesn't seem to have any adjusting ability uh the Fitbit integration even the connectivity problems I've had a little bit of connectivity issues with mine here and there but some of my friends who are also reviewing this watch right now have had a nightmare of a time just keeping it connected to their phone so I'll let them talk about that in their reviews so like I was hoping this would be some amazing watch straight from the start which I should know better right like first gen stuff is never amazing right from the go but you know it's starting from zero here like there's not a lot of bands there's not a lot of accessories for this it's 350 and for that money you could get a more mature version of a smart watch that has more features that has better battery life that has things that aren't behind a subscription paywall and that ultimately will probably be a better experience but for now it's fine for their first foray into forearm Fitness and fashion but functionally it's still far from finished oh hey look a notification from this video sponsor rocket money you might heard of them they're previously known as true bill that's when I signed up I had this service for years but this is an all-in-one Finance platform that helps you keep track of your finances and also helps you manage your money too but actually my favorite feature of Rocket money is that it helps you cancel unwanted subscriptions which can kind of just like pile up in the background so you connect your bank account it scans through all of your charges and then it puts all in one place all of your subscriptions and with like a single press of a button will let you cancel the stuff that you might have forgotten about even if there's like a free trial you signed up for a while ago you just cancel it and be done with it but also rocket money can help you lower your monthly bills for your phone internet or cable it says you literally take a picture of your bill and the app will negotiate the bills on your behalf it's kind of sick and you can also monitor your credit score right from the app it's great it's easy to save money using this thing so if you want to check it out it's free or you can unlock more features using the premium account just go to rocketmoney.com MKBHD it'll be a link right below the like button if you want to head over and check it out and I'll be over there too but until the next one thanks for watching see you later peace [Music],598.68,621.843,296.46
Marques Brownlee,U3DNz5asasA,Watch,Google,all right what's up mkbhd here and today was google's i o their annual developer conference and usually we don't see a ton of hardware at events like this but this one for whatever reason we got a ton of hardware or at least hardware announcements so there's kind of three levels of announcements going on here so first of all there's the right around the corner coming up next stuff that's two things and they're going to be going on sale in the next month or so then there's the later this year section so we did get a bit of a sneak preview at some more fall hardware some stuff that we're actually going to get fully unveiled later this year and then there's the on the horizon section which is they went ahead and pre-announced a piece of 2023 hardware for some reason but we'll get to that but first of all in the next up section pixel 6a and pixel buds pro these are both things that we kind of knew were coming but now we're finally getting all the details of these announcements so for the pixel 6a it is essentially a slightly smaller slightly bumped down pixel six and it will retail for 449. so honestly from what we can tell here the 6a will be very similar to the pixel 6. you can see the design same camera bar same glass same software with all the material you and live captions and speech recognition and camera features and it's powered by the same exact tensor chip from the flagship pixel six and six pro but you know those phones are going on past six months old now so you can imagine the price of manufacturing some of those parts is starting to go down but the real main difference between the pixel 6a and the pixel 6 which is 599 is the display and cameras which is really interesting so for the display it is smaller a little bit the more premium pixels are both pretty big this will have a 6.1 inch 1080p 60 hertz g-o-led display which is still big but it's now the smallest pixel so then cameras are the other interesting thing so now google telling us that cameras are one of the areas where they saved cost from the pixel 6 means that yeah okay this a is going to have cheaper cameras than the pixel 6 which worried me at first so it is still a standard and an ultra wide and you can kind of see a slightly new visual design in the camera bar which i'll touch on more in a second but on the spec sheet it actually tells us it is the sony imx,2.32,621.843,286.4
Marques Brownlee,U3DNz5asasA,Watch,Google,363 that's the sensor for the main camera which is actually the same 12 megapixel sensor that we've seen in some of those older pixels pixel 4 pixel 3 pixel 2 this is a tried and true older sensor so cheaper yes but also probably not bad but other things like materials and battery appear to be about the same although do definitely have to test that stuff i i would suggest getting subscribed to see that review video when it comes out here battery could be an interesting one because this is the smallest lowest refresh rate display in any pixel but it still has the same tensor chip so we'll see how that gets handled could be amazing but the other specs i can confirm are six gigs of ram and 128 gigs of storage ip67 water resistance it does have an in display fingerprint reader there's a 4400 milliamp hour battery with 18 watt charging but there is no mention of wireless charging and then sub 6 5g and millimeter wave 5g with specific models and five years of android security updates so that's the pixel 6a and that's the new budget smartphone but it's launching alongside a new high-end set of earbuds from google pixel buds pro so if we have pixel buds a series i looked on google store that's actually the only one they're selling right now so the a series for 100 bucks is like regular airpods basically and then pixel buds pro for 200 bucks would be sort of equivalent to airpods pro so this is a 199 dollar noise canceling pair of wireless earbuds they do have a transparency mode they'll have multi-device connectivity compatible with android ios and computers google assistants built-in they have ipx4 sweat resistance and overall the design i'm going to say it looks pretty tame you know you can see the mics each earbud has three microphones you got the silicon tips in front of an 11 millimeter driver and the case looks basically the same as the original pixel buds with the black and white design and the magnet and wireless charging the quoted battery life is 11 hours of listening or seven hours with active noise cancellation turned on basically i feel like the differentiating factor with these especially when we get them and listen to how they sound is gonna come from the six core audio chip on board which also apparently will have a lot to do with the noise cancellation the transparency mode and just overall the way they sound now i've been waiting a long time for a,145.44,621.843,281.67800000000005
Marques Brownlee,U3DNz5asasA,Watch,Google,pair of earbuds with noise cancellation and a transparency mode that rivals airpods airpods still to this day have far and away the best transparency mode i've ever heard in any pair of headphones so i'm looking forward to maybe pixel buds stepping their game up in that dimension it's just one part of headphones um but yeah the competition has a lot of other things going for them so we'll see how the pixel buds stack up but yeah that's what's up next that's the stuff that'll be on sale this summer but then google went ahead and gave us a little bit of a preview of some stuff that's coming up this fall including a full design reveal of the pixel 7 and 7 pro and a new pixel watch finally so this is our limited first look at the pixel 7 and 7 pro so the details of course are way more confined with this stuff but you can see the new colors here and you can also see a bit more of that camera design and super bold big camera circles and the camera bar and an extra detail is we also know that that glass is soft touch which i am very excited about so they've sort of gone back and forth on soft touch but if you remember the pixel threes with the soft touch glass i remember i really liked that back of a phone finish if it's anything like that i'm very excited about it and seeing as there is a black 7 pro at the bottom i'm thinking that's probably going to end up being the one i prefer although matt white typically does a great job hiding fingerprints so we'll see this phone will have the next generation tensor chip and it will launch with android 13 but that's pretty much all we know at this point so yeah new phone coming out this fall pixel 7 and 7 pro new chip new colors new matte finish and then yeah i guess we can also technically see it still has a port at the bottom and it definitely has speakers all the classic stuff some new colors i'm not sure how i feel about this gray with the green undertone but it does contrast well with the gold but probably the more interesting preview we got is the one of the new pixel watch they're finally doing it this fall we're going to have i mean theoretically maybe a competitor to the apple watch but sort of in the android world i've been waiting for this for a long time it's a sort of a result of their collaboration or i guess purchase of fitbit and this is it this is the pixel watch so okay it's a circular stainless steel,286.479,621.843,291.921
Marques Brownlee,U3DNz5asasA,Watch,Google,design and it is a very simple silhouette as you can see not a whole lot to set it apart on the outside but i do like that it is simple and it has what they're calling a tactile crown for input though it's also a touch screen and it has interchangeable bands and it runs wear os this is the pixel watch that we've been i mean hearing so much about for so long and waiting for it's clearly got some solid bezels all the way around i mean that's the first thing i notice when the screen is on and i guess i'm judging just by eyeballing these lifestyle photos but it looks like it's about the same size as the smaller apple watch i'm thinking maybe around 40 millimeters there isn't any mention of two different sizes like a small and a large i think it would make sense but they didn't say but basically that's all we really know know about the new pixel watch again this is something that we're gonna get way more details on when it actually does get fully unveiled in october whenever their event is but there are a bunch of things that i'm also hoping for like i'm hoping it has a bright efficient crispy oled display you know this ui they're showing has a lot of black and the black bezel clearly goes all the way around so i'm hoping that it's an oled so it can sort of seamlessly blend into the bezel instead of being really obvious and ugly like a cheaper lcd i'm also of course hoping for good battery life at least a full day and if it's going to be a premium price i'm also hoping it has things like good haptics and good performance these animations of the ui showing smart home controls and checking notifications like it's cool but again i definitely want to play with it myself one thing to note though is this is basically going to act like a fitbit like it seems like most of the the fitness tracking and sleep tracking and stuff like that you need the fitbit app to work for so it's going to act just like a fitbit in that way and then wear os is going to work the way you typically expect it to paired with an android phone and then they've said there will be a cellular option so the watch can work without the phone and it'll do activity and sleep tracking and stuff like that through fitbit and also it appears this will just be working specifically with android phones probably best with the pixel but with android phones and not the iphone because in classic apple fashion lots of the stuff that the apple,432.56,621.843,265.361
Marques Brownlee,U3DNz5asasA,Watch,Google,watch can do no other smartwatch has access to so this this is very much an android smartwatch so yeah stay tuned for more details on that later but yeah then last but not least this was the announcement we got basically zero information on but google did officially say that they're going to be dropping a pixel tablet in 2023 that's what they've told us that's kind of all we know like we don't know any of the specs we don't know what time of year it'll come out we don't know what it'll even really be called technically we do know it will be on the larger side and on the premium side so i'm thinking like ipad air to ipad pro type price range and equivalent but it feels like they're not really committing to anything else yet as far as a tablet goes i guess visually basically we just have this shot of the pixel portfolio where we can see that there is a tablet and it'll definitely have a camera and speakers and presumably a screen on the other side but yeah that's it it's really interesting that they're deciding to show off some of this stuff so early it kind of reminds me on one hand of sony who will announce a phone early in the year and then six months later it'll finally come out and all the hype is gone and everybody forgot about it but on the other hand this is google we're talking about and they've always been leaking things constantly i mean they try to get ahead of the leaks this feels like them just going hey you know what instead of the phone leaking for the next six months we'll just tell people about it and take advantage of that because otherwise you just lose the hype and your own messaging so yeah let me know what you think is the most exciting or what you're looking forward to the most of this new google stuff i'm definitely interested in in the watch actually i want to see what that's like on the wrist and to actually use but let me know in the comments section below we'll talk about it but yeah that's been it thanks for watching also random shout out but the ipod was officially discontinued this week probably one of the products everyone watching this video has at some point owned some version of so rip press f and in the chat to pay respects all right catch you guys the next one peace,565.6,621.843,253.27800000000002
Marques Brownlee,JuWF9G6SSi0,Watch,Samsung,[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and welcome to your first look and hands-on of samsung's new mid-ear drops for 2022 the flip 4 the fold 4 and a really impressive looking new pair of watches so this is everything you need to know about all of it so i'm gonna start with the phones and the theme for the phones is definitely refinement and this was already the theme last year and the year before but look in the relatively young world of foldable phones right now for being honest samsung is kind of dominating the space like there's only a few foldable phones that real people are actually buying right now and the flip is apparently the most popular folding phone in the world so the flip 4 looks and feels very much just like a flip 3. like there's really three things that are notably new about it and they're all subtle so one is a slight aesthetic trimming so the bezels are just a little bit slimmer on the inside the rails feel a little bit more trim and flat plus there's a new set of colors then two is it's a bit stronger and more durable so that's always good to see in a folding phone so the hinge is a little bit more trim and still feels very sturdy to open and close and of course stays half open for all the software features that take advantage of that and then three is there's updated specs and i'm thinking this is just me just using context clues but i'm thinking that the most noticeable improvement year over year with this phone might actually be battery life so this phone has the new snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 which has had excellent efficiency in some other phones i've tested so far plus the battery also bumps up from 3 300 to 3 700 milliamp hours that's a small thing but it's a combo that could be great for battery life plus it still fast charges up to 50 in 30 minutes not bad other than that though the hardware you're looking at is very similar to the last flip and really there's one big new software feature which is a bunch of new widgets and lock screen stuff on the outside cover screen so you gotta love the lock screen customization and the functionality potentially even matching,0.0,621.843,247.11799999999994
Marques Brownlee,JuWF9G6SSi0,Watch,Samsung,your watch face to your phone so if this was early days maybe the first one to two generations of the phone that's when you'd expect to see more tinkering with like the size of the outside screen and what it really should be capable of now that they've settled on this size though they're really just adding stuff that you can do with it so you can change quick settings take a selfie activate the flashlight accept a phone call start a new phone call all types of stuff like that this is all good quality of life stuff makes a lot of sense and i think there's flip fans out there and austin evans um who like the previous versions who are gonna like this one too but at the same time if you weren't convinced on the flip whether it's because that crease is still somewhat visible and feelable when you scroll or because you don't like the idea of having to open up the phone every time you want to use it or whatever else might have bothered you none of that has changed either so this new one probably won't change your mind and neither will the new price because it's the same as the old price 9.99 so there are other phones that you could get for this price other flagships you know gaming phones slab style phones but this one for 9.99 folds in half and it's probably the most appealing folding phone to most people but on the other end of the spectrum though is the big unfolding productivity monster the fold for so this is actually the one i'm personally most interested in and what if i told you that the exact same set of things is new on this phone too well it's actually a little bit more than that same stuff but the fold 4 also has an improved slightly slimmer hinge which is one of the most important overall pieces of this phone and it feels firm and confidence inspiring and very satisfying to clap closed which is great uh it has a nice satin finish on the back with three colors the gold the black and then this deep blue and then it does in fact have a stronger gorilla glass victus plus on the outside paired with those aluminum rails they've also updated the specs again with the same new snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 inside the highest end chip available and it does have the same size 4 400 milliamp hour,122.479,621.843,234.6409999999999
Marques Brownlee,JuWF9G6SSi0,Watch,Samsung,battery as last year and then there's a new camera system on the back as well so these folding phones have never quite had exactly the same set of cameras as the highest end flagships you know the ultra phones but they do typically get right up underneath as the next best thing so this fold here has a 50 megapixel primary camera a 12 megapixel ultra wide and a 3x telephoto which will let you get up to 30x space zoom i will definitely be testing these new cameras in these flipping folding phones in the full review just to see how good they are but if i was guessing if i was guessing they'll probably perform pretty similar to like an s22 plus which is to say pretty great we'll see though and then surprise surprise the fold four also has one big new software feature this time it's on the inside screen and that's the dock at the bottom so you'll notice when you open an app the entire dock shrinks down to the bottom into this sort of bar kind of like a windows taskbar and from there you can easily launch recent apps or hop back and forth between apps quickly or even launch straight into multitasking with two or three apps on the screen at once it's a small change but i think it makes a big difference to keeping it easy and fluid to quickly multitask on a phone like this i don't know about you but when i open the phone up and it's got this huge seven inch screen inside i just want to use a lot of stuff and multitask so you've got the button to open up any app all the way on the left you've got the navigation buttons all the way to the right i really do like this taskbar and then just flipping through the device for a bit the rest is very familiar to what we've seen just again slightly refined the outside cover screen is actually three millimeters wider so it's a slightly different aspect ratio again thanks to slimmer bezels and you can just barely tell by eyeballing it and on the inside the bezels all the way around again are just slightly thinner and the crease through the middle to my eye is a little bit less visible than it is on the flip though it's not too different from last year basically where if you're looking at the content on the screen you really don't notice it too much because,240.159,621.843,233.921
Marques Brownlee,JuWF9G6SSi0,Watch,Samsung,you don't pass your finger over it when you're scrolling like maybe you would on the vertically folding phone maybe if you're a big stylist person you'll get the whole s pen case and everything and then you really notice the crease when you draw a lot over the middle but yeah i'm not one of those people so basically it's there if you're looking for it but it's not really too bad if you're not you know what else though you probably didn't notice if you weren't looking for it the new under display selfie camera right up here on the top right hand side so samsung is using a new second generation hidden selfie camera up here and from my very limited experience it is actually very impressive just how well it's able to hide itself and stay out of view even more so than last year's first gen but the images that come out of it definitely do not look any better like that was the big weakness of last year's folds hidden camera and it appears to absolutely be the weakness of this one again you can see it does a fair amount of processing with the still photos but i imagine a video call won't look too pretty you know i'll give it a shot maybe the snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 will surprise me but that's how it looks aside from that though there's nothing fundamentally different in any technology across the board with this phone it is still very much the productivity based tablet in your pocket that we know and love just settling into its form basically if we expect any sort of different shape with a foldable from samsung that's probably just going to be a whole new phone just a whole new model so in the meantime this fold 4 launches again at the same price as last year 17.99 so i'll review both of these phones for sure but low-key maybe the most interesting new hardware to me here is actually the new pair of watches here that samsung's dropped there's a new galaxy watch 5 and galaxy watch 5 pro some of you are already remembering that i haven't reviewed too many smart watches in the past but maybe leave a thumbs up or a comment on this video if you're interested in something on these basically if you've been paying attention to apple rumors lately there's,356.88,621.843,221.75899999999996
Marques Brownlee,JuWF9G6SSi0,Watch,Samsung,been all kinds of stuff brewing about maybe an apple watch refresh in september and maybe an apple watch pro but hey here comes samsung right out the gate just ahead of that with a watch 5 and a watch 5 pro so the watch 5 has a sweet new design with a reshaped curvature and actually a flatter contact area on the bottom so there's more contact with your wrist for more accurate readings of everything there's two sizes 40 or 44 millimeters and each one has a 15 bigger battery than before thanks to the new shape for a claimed up to 50 hours on a charge there's a nice bright oled display on the front and they're covering it with a sapphire crystal glass this year and the whole thing is ip68 water resistant software wise looks pretty familiar plus they've added things like detailed sleep tracking with stages which is another thing apple just added to the apple watch but the watch 5 pro is interesting because it's a more fitness and adventure focused version of the same thing so when you see them back to back you'll notice it's it's thicker it's a little more of a ruggedized version than the standard watch they're only doing it in a large 45 millimeter size and the display is sort of inset behind these titanium bezels and the sapphire crystal cover glass they say is even stronger than the standard i assume that's just because it's thicker and they fit a 590 milliamp hour battery into this thing so pretty massive battery without actually looking like a super huge watch so they promise one and a half times the battery life of the standard watch putting it up at 80 hours and that is what i'm curious to test so the watch 5 bluetooth only starts at 279 and then the watch 5 pro at bluetooth only will start at 4 49. so interesting new hardware developments from samsung here very curious to see that stuff let me know in the comments what you're interested in seeing for the full review i am definitely looking forward to testing it but in the meantime get subscribed if you haven't already that's how you'll be among the first to see the review that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys later peace [Music],468.0,621.843,228.01900000000003
Unbox Therapy,SWrXT5X-Ke4,Watch,Apple,I've been wearing this watch around that's the ultra watch from Apple this is Apple watch Ultra reimagine with extraordinary new capabilities that expand the ways you can use Apple watch people are wondering just how capable it is whether or not it can act as a replacement entirely for a smartphone is the battery big enough Ultra has the biggest battery of any Apple watch yet is the screen big enough is our biggest brightest display ever in Apple watch I'm curious myself every detail has been engineered to create the most rugged and capable Apple watch ever so I was wondering what about A Day in the Life putting the smartphone away turning the smartphone off power off and using the cellular only on the Apple watch Ultra I wanted to see if it could survive just a regular day in my life notifications emails messages phone calls listening to music all the things this watch can do obviously this is not the way Apple's kitchen is devices but with cellular capabilities that option does become available and what if we try to replace a Smartphone come along for the ride check in with me throughout the day let's see how this battery's making out and let's see where the pain points are this is switching from a smartphone to an Apple Watch Ultra exclusively foreign we're kicking it off at 10 49. this has been off the charger for like 20 minutes at this point still at 100. I have the always on display turned on that can be one of the bigger battery drains notifications from almost every application are going to be coming through to this as well today so let's go ahead and turn off the smartphone by the way quick shout out we got all the colors in for the 14 series 14 pro and pro Max for later case so now I got the coffee color on with the texture I'll put a link in the description I just just had to put that I realize you haven't seen that one before power off night night no more phone for the day slightly terrifying all right so a key part of this video is connecting air pods to the watch we have the new airpods I was like oh perfect moment and this is what's in the package they're in the studio somewhere but we had to find them now and will do might be involved that by the way that's not an accusation of any kind he just might know where they are so let's find him first hello emotional Express will inform you for the last time that you have a parcel that has been delivered twice and no one has signed for it even switching to the watch doesn't save you from that all right it's 1 30 now uh we're about to go get some coffee our battery life is 93 still this is the easy part of the day in studio like I said not hunting for cellular towers on Wi-Fi once we get out in the world which we're about to do right now it's going to start to stress this battery out a little bit more so let's go do that I have the Starbucks app like can I still get the points and like the free drinks or whatever the rewards are for using the app at least in the case of Starbucks there is an app and you can pay with it they'll just scan the barcode like they would if you had your phone so this is another area where the,0.0,621.843,404.56000000000006

Unbox Therapy,SWrXT5X-Ke4,Watch,Apple,the best experience with smart watches given kind of what I've thrown at it to this point I'd say this 58 percent is a success sitting here at 8 20 PM we're just going to continue using it until it actually hits zero we'll see what happens and I'll see you in a bit the watch is still going it's still kicking I just paid for this coffee and this bagel no I'm down with the sponsorship it's fine okay so it looks like you can't get very much data on the watch itself not ideal pretty much all you're able to see in the watch is the amount of time slept little line and then a graph of a previous period of time obviously if I was in the app on the phone I would have a totally different interface which would show me a lot more information not ideal this marks roughly 24 hours since this was originally taken off the charger at 100 battery so we have crossed the 24 hour threshold 22. I'm still going there and I've been listening it's 12 22. we're coming dangerously close now to Apple's stated 36 hours of battery life under normal use this has been abnormal though because they expect it to be in proximity of a phone most of the time my phone has now been off for 26 hours like you feel as though you're missing something but you haven't lost connectivity but you've lost that urge to just randomly consume stuff 12 25 13 battery this is a high-end device designed for work and for people experience that we can build today pre-order today really excited we have finally dipped below 10 percent done done nine we're in the single digits there is a kind of uh range anxiety going on where I was just out and I was like I can pick up a coffee and then I was like oh like what if this thing what if I go to four and and two and I'm trying to pay for things and my phone's not there in reality you start thinking about charging it again at something like 20 15 to 20 so in most cases you'd be plugging it back in at this point workday continues you're on my watch right now and so like it's a public phone call like most listening I'm trying to run down the batteries still the battery hasn't died on this yet okay sounds good seven it's four o'clock holy just the watch that never dies update okay so I just published the Hummer EV video if you didn't watch that go watch that that video is go watch that video these are this is a series I'm giving you a serious look right now I put out the harmony V video I answered a couple of emails and I sent a couple of texts on the watch itself no phone in sight watch life living on its own I think we have like two hours left my battery's three percent after that endeavor I also turned off Wi-Fi as you can see there in order to run down the battery more quickly which it does ever so slightly I don't know how many people are prepared to completely replace their phone with a watch and I don't think it's many but I think some are,682.86,621.843,435.82000000000016

Unbox Therapy,bXdaRNL1mro,Watch,Apple,well it's obviously apple time of year it's the new phones the new products and uh holiday season in general people are looking for i don't know gifs people are looking to upgrade the devices that they have today i have a device that i didn't look at that was well i guess it was overlooked by myself but it's it's getting looked at now today because i received a very special version of it inside this box is the new apple watch the series six but it's from aurum edition and you may recall that these guys in the past they've sent me some very luxurious smell versions of iphones it is an iphone 11 pro you know ornate and gold-plated and featuring precious stones well that's what's in this box i thought now is the time for me to check out the apple watch series six and also prepare for the iphone 12 because maybe i slipped the sim card in the iphone 12 and then i got to figure out what watch to wear and i think most people agree if you if you're on the iphone at least then it's gonna be an apple watch so anyway let's go ahead and first off appreciate the packaging here with the rosewood on the top once you get to a certain price point with luxurious gadgets you're talking about what all right there's no cardboard in sight you go i don't know this might be brass this engraving over here and you lift it up and there's got to be a pillow involved have you ever purchased a luxury watch before i haven't either to be honest with you that said it would probably be on a pillow quite like this so i'm gonna remove that oh my goodness look at the clasp gold-plated clasp going on all right just let me put that down for a second and lift up this portion of the package you see the smooth it's the smooth felt is it felt alcantara i don't know what it is it's soft all right it's soft and then it's uh it's pretty much that it's your little charge puck thing to go with it in the old days there used to be many versions of the apple watch charging devices that were out there now it's been simplified it is this portable little puck and that's that unless you opt for apple's latest their brand new charger which is the dual wireless charger in which case then it has a spot for the apple watch as well as the iphone 12 or other qi compatible wireless charging phone all right so this is your little charger right here i'm gonna pull the pillow out from in here now it's important to note that this is a crazy premium watch that right there i didn't take this part off yet that right there is a real sapphire that's a real sapphire i don't know what the current cost of sapphires are but they sound expensive and uh they probably are i mean and i'm not talking about a sapphire uh glass front i'm talking about a sapphire gem stone right there on the digital crown okay so this is it look at that that's a statement right there people are gonna know well people are gonna notice that's not an everyday apple watch and then we remove the cover and that's what it looks like whoa so you check out the engraving here you know when i was a youngster i had a pocket knife a brass pocket knife with very similar engraving around it this is a this is tough work because everything is so small even on the button it's got the engraving going on and we are booting up right now the back of the device we can see this is based on the 44 millimeter aluminum and ceramic case now they can base it off of the stainless version and they come in at different prices i'll give you a price right now ladies and gentlemen and it's going to scare you this is the sapphire crown series 6 gold 40 millimeter or 44 and in the sport gps version which is the one that i have here we're looking at 2 800 dollars the watch case is plated with yellow 24 karat gold sapphire stone installed on the watch crown,0.0,621.843,543.0420000000001
Unbox Therapy,bXdaRNL1mro,Watch,Apple,deep anthracite black strap mine actually got an upgrade i guess this is the the blue version top quality embossed crocodile leather the watch is hand engraved which makes the fashionable design absolutely unique now as mentioned you can get it based on the stainless steel version but that's going to cost you a little bit more since the initial cost is a little bit more so that goes up to 3 200 this is a premium this is a luxury piece they have a few different crazy versions on there as expected anyway as a watch as a smartwatch i actually haven't used the apple watch series in a pretty long time i have bounced around i like to use a variety of products and i spent time on android so as as mentioned here and as featured here i've been trying out a lot of different smartwatch devices the latest being this one which is the new fitbit sense which has a tremendous number of sensors in it it actually has more sensors than the apple watch series 6. the other device i used previous to that was the previous version of the polar vantage which is a fitness watch which i like the styling of because i kind of like a rugged watch and it had a very accurate heart rate monitor which uh i liked for the fitness aspects when i would hop on the bike and things like this this one took to another level it got real crazy added some of the apple watch features including ecg blood oxygen which i'm tracking and the sleep tracking on the fitbit sense is actually beyond what apple's doing on the apple watch by showing you things like deep sleep and rem sleep and and i mean it even has a temperature sensor to to constantly monitor the temperature of your skin and potentially your stress levels so fitbit is they're fully going towards the health tracking aspect now the other one which i also featured recently is this the apple watch which is an android compatible version of essentially the apple watch and no it doesn't have all the same sensors but it does have a similar styling with an even larger surface area there so you can go check out this video as well for another comparison so as you can see i've tried out a bunch of different things and it's probably time to hop back on the apple train a little bit and give a test to their latest generation however the apple watch series 6 is not all that different than the series 5. the blood oxygen sensor that's in here is pretty much the only new thing alongside supposedly improved battery life and also a faster chip now when it comes to battery life i would say look how luxury i am right now man you see this guy roll up i i show up to baseball practice with this that's a hell of a look for the jays with the blue as well oh no i gotta show up to the post the post game interview with this on and here's the thing a watch has been a style piece for a really long time more so than a phone when they started to upgrade these phones and due to luxury models there it was cut maybe a little bit more absurd but a watch has been kind of a personalized or a personal item in which you would you would pick one up to sort of represent your style because you wear it on the outside of your body that's one of the drawbacks with these smart watches i mean certainly over here like what is the identity of this this has zero personality at all it's just a i mean it's just a little puck that sits on your wrist and the apple watch without customization now i know you can get different colors and things like this it's a pretty basic design which is good too because then you don't get bored of it but what if you want to you know i don't know do have a more you want to have a night out [Laughter] why don't you just won't be flashy for a second and then that's where this comes in now granted this is like 3 000 bucks i would suggest the cheaper way of doing this is just pick up some extra wrist straps and and you're good to go and now you have a totally,275.04,621.843,482.07899999999984
Unbox Therapy,bXdaRNL1mro,Watch,Apple,different look but this with the engraving and whatnot it really has a luxury look to it but on on a simple form which is of course the apple watch all right now let me check out the heart rate the heart rate on top of this uh hairy wrist right here let's see what we get let's see how fast the reading comes in apple watch has been one of the most accurate smart watches it's been tracked online comparative to uh your your chest straps which are like the industry norm from guys like these guys polar who make them i'd say sitting here right now talking a couple coffees deep this is this is probably where i'm at one of the things is the update frequency like how how often it shows me that increase or decrease but this is going to be sufficient for a lot of people and when it comes to the smartwatch characteristics with notifications and things outside of health that's really where the apple watch shines as well because the integration with the phone is so far beyond whatever somebody like fitbit or polar can do all right let's go ahead and just unbox this polar real quick because i haven't checked out their new version the vantage v2 they've upgraded the heart rate tracking in here as well get under the skin of who you are when you understand your body better you plan better train smarter and recover fully because the more you know the better you can become well i know that gets kirk fired up i don't myself i'm still going to need to see a little bit more but kirk's already getting going on that that's a very easy top removal i'm just going to put that out there i've unboxed a few things in the past all right so inside the package this looks like a tremendous chunk of paperwork right here getting started and i'll never read that but it's there oh that's cool look they did like an army green on the wristband the wristband looks identical to my previous model this is metallic it's cold to the touch and look how rugged look at the styling you see i wish there was like a more rugged apple watch or or fitbit product as well because i've actually been enjoying some of the sleep tracking going on with the fitbit it's a little bit more comprehensive but anyways uh yeah i wish that there was there was some more robust uh styling to go with it this has a strap by the way that locks in it doesn't move around this little piece will clip it in at a second point so this is this is a very secure wristband i used the previous version of the vantage so i'm familiar with it it looks like this wristband is the same it just happens to be in this like army green the rear of the device look at the look at this sensor right here this gonna bite through all the hairs on my wrist it's a substantial many contact points many leds i mean comparatively let's see you see my the puny little fitbit is just flashing right now just a couple of leds in green and comparatively some of these fitness products because they have a bigger base to start with you can get some tremendous uh tracking on there and it kind of locks on like i find that the discrepancy or or bizarre unexplained jumps in heart rate this one is just rock solid for me at least the previous model all right also inside the package here we are gonna have uh this is the worst part actually about this watch series is the charge puck all right this is the charge puck right here and it's a usb connector that's a pretty self-explanatory but this piece this piece drive me crazy it's a weak magnet and i would say it is the probably the thing that i dislike the most about this series and trust me i use the vantage v1 for a long period you line up this little oh oh wait a sec it's a better i think they did they strengthen the magnets nah maybe a little bit they may have improved it a little bit they i think they improved it this is my technique so this thing is,517.44,621.843,491.6
Unbox Therapy,bXdaRNL1mro,Watch,Apple,plugged in and then i come like this oh they improved it okay maybe i'm less mad they improved it i still feel a more satisfying click on the fitbit and then of course if we're talking about the apple watch series six it's got i just broke this watch i mean i don't think i actually did okay yes on the apple watch side pretty self-explanatory little puck and super easy to hit the right spot so apple has totally figured that one out you can see with this one since the watch doesn't lay flat you kind of got to come from the side so still not my favorite but i don't have the fitbit charger right now to compare either uh it works and at least they improved the magnet a little bit on this one so this is a circular display it is nowhere near as bright or vibrant as the fitbit or the apple watch or the apple watch for that matter now this is just a setup screen but it almost has like an e-ink brightness to it the consequence of this though is tremendous battery life sometimes depend again depending on how often i was using the features heart rate tracking things like that i was looking at many days of battery life on this particular device and i know it's a huge argument in the smart watch space because like guys like kirk i don't get it lou i charge my watch every night but they they had some of them have cool uh sleep tracking when do you slap track to sleep because these two they take about an hour and a half to charge up when do you do that maybe at your desk and you can still track sleep but i don't even sit at the same spot for that long so i hate the fact it's probably the only drawback with the apple watch which of course dominates the smartwatch category is the fact that this is a charge every night device that and i know i don't know what apple said officially but everything you will find online anyone who's used these extensively they're charging it every single night so there goes your sleep track for the most part i understand there are ways around it this one is right in between the two what they were able to do with the new fitbit sense what i noticed with this one i could get up to five days of battery life on this using it in in a conservation type of way but definitely at least two total days and then with the hour and a half charge time i will usually just pile it up maybe when i'm in the shower or something just pop it on for a little bit and and top it up and and that proved to be okay so the smarter the watch definitely the nicer the display the less the battery life so you have to factor that in for yourself all right so what's the story how does this all break down uh so apple watch series six if you're on an iphone i think it's a pretty easy and obvious choice as a smart watch it's it has the most features hands down particularly you can configure it with lte in there you can use it without a smartphone attached to it the notification system the microphone it will uh warn you of uh loud environments they've just it's just a very comprehensive wrist computer and so i think that's why it's as popular as it is however on the fitness side and certainly on the android side you have people looking at other devices for other reasons i think the one major reason to look elsewhere if you're on ios is just battery life if you're cool with charging every night then the apple watch is is a pretty straightforward choice you can start to look elsewhere if that's not the case and then you can also start to look elsewhere if styling is not what you want on the apple watch because it's well this is not a standard apple watch but this type of styling will cost you if you want to go more in the sporty direction you might find yourself looking at something like this which is pretty squarely focused on fitness and not much else,769.92,621.843,479.2800000000001
Unbox Therapy,bXdaRNL1mro,Watch,Apple,all right let's test out some of the sensors here oh also assistant assistant google assistant is coming to the fitbit sense it also has amazon alexa to speak to it so it does have a microphone you're using siri obviously if you're on the apple watch blood o2 all right here's the new sensor in the series six the blood o2 make sure your wrist is not too low make sure it's not too low on your rest okay should be snug it is but comfortable all right facing up don't move 98 all right i'll take it so you can do this on demand and it can also track it over time just like the fitbit sense can do i like the fact that you can do it on demand on the apple watch that's actually a thing you can't do on the fitbit sense it will just tell you your spo2 from the previous evening and the range whereas i can just do an on the spot check right here like as if you went to the emergency room at the hospital and you stuck your finger into the little sensor and you just needed feedback quickly same thing goes for the ecg functionality as well all right check it out that's interesting so you have to actually install the app it's not on there by default it gives a little description of how it's going to interact with your heart now this is not a new feature by the way but this does look to be maybe a little more comprehensive than the version i was using on the fitbit sense it cannot detect a heart attack it cannot detect blood clots or stroke it can not detect other heart related conditions it's important to note as well if you're younger these things are not as accurate or as useful apparently it's not recommended for people under the age of 22 or something like that to get accurate feedback for whatever reason uh so just keep that in mind if you're not feeling well you should talk to your doctor okay cool are we ready cool ecg app okay oh check check that hold your finger oh no my digital crown has a sapphire on it this is not gonna work the ecg requires touching of the crown i have a sapphire on my crown right now so i'm gonna go ahead and recommend that you don't do the sapphire crown version of the customization if you want a very luxurious apple watch because you're going to kill one of the key features unless you absolutely could care less about doing an ecg or using the ecg feature in which case it's a non-issue however since i do want to do an on-air ecg which would be a first for me what i'm going to do is boot the fitbit sense back up because it also has that feature and it's implemented a little bit differently where you touch the two sides or two corners of the device oh by the way this if you're interested this one also has a touch sensitive button over here this is with haptic and that's how you turn the watch on ecg put your index finger and thumb on the corner metal and then it counts down from 30. and what's interesting is apple's implementation is one point of contact whereas the fitbit sense asks for asks for two points of contact normal sinus rhythm your heart's rhythm appears normal it still says if you're not feeling well go talk to somebody learn more this would also tell me if if there was any indication of an abnormal finding which is the same thing that the apple watch would do i guess you would only ever boot up the ecg app if you have a pre-existing heart condition that you would want to check up on that or if you're experiencing some sort of issue and want to take a reading but anyway look there you have it smart watches yeah it's a cool expanding marketplace apple watch is still number one at the top and the series six is no different and this just happens to be a hyper luxurious version of it which is believe it or not the first one that's shown up in studio so if you have something like three grand in your pocket that's burning a hole you can look towards uh flexing with the most elaborate version of the current apple watch this one is ballin so out of control that you have completely covered up core functionality in order to show off your sapphire this is such a weird video,1010.079,621.843,548.6819999999999
Unbox Therapy,xCPjrHjdTRw,Watch,Apple,so i've been around a block with uh smart watches semi-smart watches regular watches i was into g-shock watches for a while before i ever dabbled in the smart watch game then i got into some of the fitness trackers and i just been all over the place trying these things out now many of you know that i spend most of my time on android i use all the various smartphones as they're released but because there's so many android flagships over the course of the year i spend most of my time on android so i've been following the android wear situation since the early days since the moto 360 circular smart watch i feel like i even went to chicago to see the very first version of that and uh you know i've just been sort of tracking it ever since now from me today i have oppo's latest android wear device which at first glance i mean it's impossible not to note that it looks very inspired by the apple watch now i mean that could be a good thing or a bad thing it it really depends on your perception apple watch is obviously a very popular wearable and and for good reason so to adopt some of the attributes of that device it kind of makes sense and there's actually some features in here that kind of go beyond some of the functionality from a hardware standpoint that the apple watch is capable of like for example really fast charging that apple pulled from their smartphone business so in front of me i have two different watches this is the 46 millimeter size it does come in a smaller size as well i mean everything the unboxing experience you could tell it's very apple watch-ish and i have a black one and a gold one in front of me these are both wi-fi only models but they do also sell an lte version which has a built-in e-sim if you want to use it in the absence of having to carry your smartphone you can actually get calls notifications go on a jog with just a watch and no phone depending on what market you're in you may see a different price however i would expect to find this model for below 300 and the entry level model at 41 millimeters around 200 or just over 200 so it makes it cheaper than the apple watch it kind of well basically it kind of gives you an apple watch for android that's sort of the idea all right so let's start off with the unboxing experience for the black model it looks like i don't even need the knife maybe i do okay so we have a black strap to go with the black watch obviously this is like a i mean you're probably familiar with this material it's like a rubberized,0.08,621.843,336.32000000000005
Unbox Therapy,xCPjrHjdTRw,Watch,Apple,type of fit this is going to be good for sweat and exercise uh it's you know water is going to beat off of it actually the quality of it it actually feels very much more apple watch-ish than i even imagined this is it's sturdy one thing that's different if you look closely here you have curvature on each side of the display and oppo they kind of make a big deal of that in the press kit talking about how this is usually a feature reserved for flagship smartphones well here when you're scrolling between different pages you have this nice curvature on each side the black color almost has like a bluish hue to it and you can see your buttons on the side here one is designated with this kind of green indicator there's another large button above there and then the back side houses your various sensors for heart rate of course you're doing the fitness stuff and this is for your fast charging removing the bands there's a button here for a quick release just like this and you're gonna need to use their accessory bands in order to take advantage of that obviously but it will give you that sort of fast on fast off functionality also inside the package we have the charger and as mentioned i've used so many different wearable devices over the years i found myself paying tons of attention to the charger and charge speed because it's one of the drawbacks of these devices it's another device to keep charged so charge speed matters and they've used their voop technology from their smartphones to improve charge times they claim in 15 minutes you can get a day of battery life of course this is going to depend on your typical usage how frequently you're using the heart rate and things like this but nonetheless it charges faster than most competing smart watches for android wear this is how the dock is going to work it's kind of that's kind of a nice little fit it's got a little rubber pad on the bottom so it doesn't slip around too much it goes home on its own so a magnet sort of pulls it into place now this other side is going to plug into your power brick you're gonna have to supply power also in the package we have a little bit of paperwork and what is this oh this is an extra band holder to go around here i guess if you happen to lose that one oh okay so this one is sort of like a rose gold type of coloring with a much lighter band to it so two very different looks for the same watch with the 46 millimeter sizing they feel surprisingly precious uh surprisingly special given the cost,168.16,621.843,350.08

Unbox Therapy,OE-Y-PotqTQ,Watch,Apple,fine : how do produced I don't even use these I know yeah I feel like I'm uh I'm making a case allow me to make a case please if you don't mind I appreciate you spending the time by the way the camera yes these things it's a massive camera setup you've got the versatility you've got the telephoto you've got the wide on on the pro model and of course you have only the two cameras set up on the non pro model but let's just talk about the pro model the flagship how often does the average person end up just snapping a photo with the main camera unit anyway and we know that the iPhone 11 Pro it's got one of the best main camera units on any phone period it's got the price tag to match so you sit down you save yourself 399 and I have the same at least that's what Apple's telling us now have the same camera performance as the main camera on a phone that's well over a thousand dollars in most configurations many configurations say hmm ok I can't bust into the wide-angle I can't zoom in on a telephoto I don't have the versatility but as far as that one-to-one comparison boom I pop off a shot and I have flagship quality camera operation at 399 that's a bit of a win is it not call me crazy you guys do it anyways it's a bit of a win is it not number three is gonna be form factor there's just people out there they have to exist they must be real there's people out there who are not all about this big phone trend I know it's mostly not us in this community here but there's got to be some people out there they pick up these big devices geez man I can't can't handle it it's not me I'm not saying it's me I think it's one of the reasons that the pro model comes in smaller than the first non pro 11 they gave people a flagship option that's smaller than most other flagship options from other brands so Apple's thinking about it what are people's hand sizes what ik what can people put up with and so for those that are out there that just don't want to scale this thing up they want a slim and trim little package for the pocket and I presume those people exist then that's another reason they're gonna look at the SE so just to recap price is number one the camera and I'll include the processor in there as well that the power the computing power that's in,450.74,621.843,293.15100000000007
Unbox Therapy,OE-Y-PotqTQ,Watch,Apple,there as well the modernization of that component but mostly the camera all right we have price camera and size and that's kind of how this SE shakes out I keep referencing the iPhone 8 is the se because for all intents and purposes that's exactly what we're dealing with now the downsides they're fairly obvious you have an antiquated look and I'm gonna keep grabbing for the 7 because I might as well because the look is essentially the same - the glass back you have a very dated look you have a phone that you're gonna pull out of your pocket and absolutely no one is gonna point it that and say hey man cool phone this is not gonna happen granted who cares maybe for some people but maybe you're not even gonna look at it and say anything hey cool phone you're gonna are you gonna be inspired looking at this slab I doubt it does that matter to you you have to evaluate you have to look at it for a person like me on the enthusiast side I like to see the future big bright OLED display go ahead and blame me all right that's where I'm at in 2020 so I think the bad points on it are fairly obvious so I don't really need to recap all of them and certainly if you're willing to expand your horizon and look out to the various other brands that exist globally $3.99 is not chump change you can get some pretty futuristic looking phones for 399 but I really don't think that's who this se2 is for this se2 is for those people that I referenced earlier that wide variety of people and believe me it is a wide variety of people so as uninspiring as this thing might be for people like us we have to understand the play we have to look at what Apple's trying to do and when you combine the global situation with that group of people who are already trending that way the global situation with the economic slowdown and all the rest of it maybe price is this killer feature above all else maybe that's why people have been very sensitive about this recent oneplus launch I've been reading the comments people say what is it that's not that's not the oneplus DNA maybe that's why it's baby is price above all else anyway you let me know what you think that's what I think here it is this is the iPhone se too I mean you can't tell the difference looking at it [Music] [Music],610.99,621.843,327.33900000000006

[I've] got one right [here] You know it was a big deal everyone was talking about it. I never really ended up wearing it every day I stuck to my classic G-Shock as you can see right here, and there's a reason for that I like a bigger watch. I like a tougher watch. I don't want to baby this stuff around I don't want to you know treat. It like it belongs in a jewelry box. It's nice I'm glad it's stainless steel and all that, but I'm not really a fancy type of dude I mean If it comes to my gadget sometimes maybe I want to kick it a little bit fancy but for the most part I'm rugged",0.06,621.843,36.766000000000005

Maybe this is the middle ground right here, so let's crack it open and see If we're feeling just to touch more manly then when we got here I know that's hard to iMagine oh Man, I like it already I look how Fat that strap is this is what I'm talking about man.

They kind of just slide out They just slide out like that I actually replace the band on this one with this cool leather one put one on one side one on the other That's my guess right now.

You know that's what I'm going for like I said nothing too Fancy or delicate just As you know on a higher-end apple watch you're already working with a much more durable display You've got the the sapphire infused type of glass. I made a bunch of videos [on] that as well Now you put something like this on to protect the the actual body of the watch this isn't gonna be for everybody let's let's be Straight here.

Unbox Therapy,G4m0EzQ9ziA,Watch,Apple,what's up guys Lew here back with another video and today we're gonna talk about customizing your Apple watch as you see here I have a third party band installed on my watch this has like a carbon fiber look with some red stitching it's just a basic band off Amazon I'll actually link it down in the description if you are interested but essentially I've gone ahead and installed this instead of the stock leather band that came with my Apple watch now you're probably wondering Lou how did you do that because I've seen all these different Kickstarter projects for adapters that people are saying are necessary to swap out your watch band or maybe you've seen Apple's other bands that are available for purchase,0.06,621.843,91.799
Unbox Therapy,G4m0EzQ9ziA,Watch,Apple,independently that started around $200 and go to $600 but I'm here to show you the simplest most straightforward way to put any watch band you want onto your Apple watch using a simple inexpensive screwdriver what really so this little screwdriver features a pentalobe tip which is quite unusual and probably not in your toolbox though Apple has been using this style of screw for a while now on various devices from iPhones to Mac books and of course now in the Apple watch this is a tiny little version of it I will link this exact model down in the description if you want to do this kind of surgery yourself so before we get into this process I need to mention quickly that in order to do a swap out like this,45.51,621.843,91.41099999999997
Unbox Therapy,G4m0EzQ9ziA,Watch,Apple,independently with your own third party watch band you'll need to start with the leather watch straps setup from Apple so my recommendation is to purchase an Apple watch with this band pre-installed therefore the third party options will be configurable with your Apple watch now the reason for this is because of the setup the way that this mechanism works on the leather band you have this metallic loop here that goes through as opposed to some of the other band styles which travel straight into the metallic connector itself and when you remove these you'll notice right away on the leather band setup that you have these two screw points here tiny tiny little pentalobe screws upon removing these screws be very,91.35,621.843,90.75
Unbox Therapy,G4m0EzQ9ziA,Watch,Apple,careful not to strip them and also not to lose them because as mentioned they are tiny but I'll go ahead and show you what happens when you remove these screws so after removing these screws you'll be left with a few components the two screws themselves this metal bar and then this other bar that travels right through the strap itself and connects like this so this part is the key component this is what will enable you to install any watch band any standard watch band that uses this same style and believe me there are tons to choose from so you can set something up that's completely unique to yourself no Kickstarter required so reinstalling the strap works exactly the same way as you break it down you just insert these,136.92,621.843,86.398
Unbox Therapy,G4m0EzQ9ziA,Watch,Apple,metal rods back into the strap they will connect in the center you'll sort of be able to line that up yourself then you take this connector portion line that back up should fit on very easily then take your tiny little pentalobe screws and attempt to fit them in there and then you just go ahead and tighten down these screws making sure not to over tighten them but that's really it fairly straightforward to screws and you can put any watch strap you want onto your Apple watch so long as you're starting with the leather band instead of a different one anyway guys there you have it a custom Apple watch strap setup hope you enjoyed this content and you found it useful if you did make sure to leave a thumbs up down below subscribe if you haven't yet and I will catch you on the next episode now go customize your Apple watch later guys,178.829,621.843,106.90200000000002

I've done a couple of videos about the Apple Watch. I did an unboxing of ... This Apple Watch right here which... Is the standard version - The Non Sport Featuring a higher quality... Or more expensive materials. But I also did a video before that... A scratch test on this component... Here which is the Glass from the Apple Watch Sport. It's called Ion X and it's not Nearly as hard as pure Sapphire. Apparently, up until This point, Sapphire Crystals Have been of a certain shape And a certain style, for Many traditional watches. So I went out and did a little Bit of my own research, I even went to",0.0,621.843,47.82
Unbox Therapy,3rrrKEYY6Kg,Watch,Apple,"A jewelry store and bought a Watch, so in front of me here, I have a Teso watch, now I've been told that Most, if not all Teso Watches feature Sapphire Crystals This one, for example, if you Turn it around and look at the back, you will see It is branded as stainless steel water resistant sapphire crystal So a legit 100 percent sapphire crystal on this watch I wanted to compare that To the sapphire crystal that exists on the Apple watch maybe Apple was using some unique material Or some kind of a process to get the Sapphire in the shape that it's In on the standard Apple watch or maybe That they weren't necessarily using the kind of sapphire crystal that we're used Too This my friends is a diamond tester This tests the conductivity of various materials. It's used mostly for evaluating Jewelry and fine stones like diamonds hence the name but it actually works perfectly fine on materials like Sapphire As well. Mineral glass will have no effect on this scale When tested when you touch this probe against it Whereas Sapphire or materials like it, diamond, so on and so forth",48.0,621.843,75.399
Unbox Therapy,3rrrKEYY6Kg,Watch,Apple,"which are very conductive materials will have a different type readout it will go as far as seven or this scale depending on the sensitivity so this is a definitive test for determining whether or not you are dealing with a sapphire crystal on a watch you have to have your hand on this metallic portion on the other side up the diamond tester and you also need to be holding the object that you're testing because it actually your body that will complete the circuit and allow for the test to be accurate so in front me here I have various devices I have my phone I have the Apple watch, the more expensive Apple watch. I have the glass from the Apple watch sport right here I have that tea so that I told you I purchased with actual verified sapphire glass sapphire crystal, sorry, on the front and then I have Elgg watch are on the far left so we're gonna go ahead and test all these different surfaces so we can find out once and for all if Apple is using legitimate sapphire crystal in the more expensive Apple watch so I'm gonna go ahead and turn on diamond selector two. How serious does that sound? Now you will need to set the sensitivity this is built in for various sizes of diamond stones that you might be testing in this case %uh put a relatively low sensitivity on their It will lead the reacting. You'll see the meter go up the scale",123.409,621.843,85.83000000000001
Unbox Therapy,3rrrKEYY6Kg,Watch,Apple,"or it won't at all. Let's start with the G watch R from LG. So you have no reaction here at all so we know immediately based on this test, that the conductivity of this material that we are dealing with glass now we can expect a similar readout from the iPhone 6 exact same effect now if I go ahead and test the glass from Apple watch sport once again glass No reaction at all. Certainly not sapphire or any kind of special material. So let's go ahead and move on to the critical stuff here I've got fifty so watch traditional style watch that I purchased for about three hundred dollars with a verified sapphire crystal by touching a you'll see the meter jump all the way up to the sensitivity setting and I have is presuming but this is diamond be as it is a really big surface of material and I have the sensitivity said for that kind of reaction. Now lastly we have the Apple watch which many have disputed whether or not its legitimate traditional watch dial sapphire because of the shape a bit and and the unusual manufacturing process that would probably take to make it here's the test and what you'll see is it gets pretty high flashing up to an",209.239,621.843,95.641
Unbox Therapy,3rrrKEYY6Kg,Watch,Apple,"8. It becomes obvious that Apple is certainly using sapphire crystal here we're seeing something fairly innovative hear from Apple in their manufacturing process that they were capable of producing something so unusual in the watch World a sapphire crystal in this particular shape with this rounded edge. Believe it or not the production of sapphire crystals for watch it is a fairly complicated thing I will drop some links in the description to describe and explain more and once you do some reading or little bit of research understand why this is such an achievement and why there were so many people doubting that it could actually be that material, given the current production methods for sapphire crystal for watches Alright, guys.

Anybody who's wondering, asking questions trying to decide between Apple watch sport or the Apple watch the next step up. I can tell you this is stainless steel in sapphire just as they say in this is one of the hardest materials on the planet so it should be incredibly resistant to scratches or at least as resistant as we could ask, for this is a great material Alright.

Unbox Therapy,te689fEo2pY,Watch,Apple,magnetic portion that will connect to the back of your apple watch a lot of the docks that are coming out still utilize this cable you just run it through the dock instead of having to get a completely different setup all right the watch itself that's a nice box it's got like a a suede on the inside here here's the watch itself whoa wow there's an essence of quality here in the experience so far most definitely so leather band with the classic clasp classic clasp wow looks looks really nice in this stainless steel again with the ceramic back this is the 42 millimeter size let's go ahead and try it on and let's see compared to this g-shock oh it's not too bad i probably could handle a larger one to be completely honest with you so you just put it on like a standard watch this like i said is the classic wristband so that's what it looks like mounted up on my wrist it looks like it has a bit of a charge so let's see if it boots up here okay so we're doing the setup process right now as you can see you first start by selecting your language and you can get a sense right now for how this digital crown works for scrolling through lists okay so now it wants to pair up immediately hold the apple watch,87.759,621.843,162.002
Unbox Therapy,te689fEo2pY,Watch,Apple,up to the camera alright cool okay very cool pairing process it's asking me for my wrist preference so left is where i will wear it let's select left uh use siri or don't use siri alright siri i'll give you a chance i'll give you a chance siri add a password do i need a password on my watch now i'm gonna say no for now so it says i'll get an alert when it's done syncing okay we are on i got a haptic buzz on my wrist and i am greeted with this watch face right here no events today not a big calendar user it's got the time which it found from the phone obviously the weather i guess yeah the weather up there i can change the watch face there are plenty of options in here you've got it was set on one called utility followed by modular simple skipped one there motion astronomy color solar chronograph mickey of course we're going to go with mickey tapping his foot periscope look at that i just got a periscope notification right on my wrist as we are making this video so this button here brings up my contacts here i've got the weather i like this modular watch face gives you a few options in,169.2,621.843,161.51900000000003
Unbox Therapy,te689fEo2pY,Watch,Apple,one spot this button here brings up all of your different apps you've seen this probably demonstrated on the official keynote and whatnot uh but this is essentially how you navigate camera i wonder what that does oh i can activate the shutter cool i can activate the shutter from the watch that's very cool so since it's a smart watch it's objective is to move notifications from your phone onto your wrist that means text messages emails but let's go ahead and take a closer look around the hardware instead you can see on the front here we have what they're calling the sapphire retina display again this is different than what you would get on the sport model if you haven't seen my sport model scratch video scratch test video i'll link it down in the description i know a lot of you have but this is supposed to be an upgraded version or a harder surface which should be less likely to be scratched you have a stainless steel enclosure as i mentioned before here you can get a closer look at the digital crown very smooth operation and then the other button on the device on the back here you have your heart rate sensor in this location here for health and fitness people if you can't tell i'm one of those people this is also where you charge the device too this is where,250.319,621.843,158.80100000000002
Unbox Therapy,te689fEo2pY,Watch,Apple,your charge cable is going to connect let me go ahead and test that out there you go so just it just kind of fits right on there anyway that's also where you have your heart rate sensor and there's a a little inscription around the outside which has your serial number as well the watch band identifies itself as natural leather and the 42 millimeter version as i understand it this clasp down here is once again stainless steel three oh hi lunch guy you know what i like what that he does he honks the horn like a wild man right but then he gets out of the car and goes and checks case you didn't hear the me honking my horn okay for a quick size comparison here i have the apple watch on the far left this is the lg g watch and this is the lg g watch r lgg uh this is one of the biggest smart watches i've ever had but as you can see the apple watch does trend on the smaller size as far as overall dimensions are concerned okay so there you have it the apple watch 42 millimeter stainless steel it's a pretty looking thing no doubt about it the unboxing experience as you can tell very special very elegant this is by no means a review video i just got the thing i'm looking at it for the first time if you enjoyed this video make sure to leave a thumbs up down below subscribe if you haven't yet and i will catch you on the next episode it's time to go start installing some apps,330.32,621.843,190.24099999999999
Unbox Therapy,ORIQXujC2v8,Watch,Apple,what's up guys Lew here back with another video and today I've got something exclusive for you as you know there's been an enormous amount of hype around the brand-new Apple watch but in advance of actually receiving the watch I actually got the opportunity to check out the surface material that will be used for the face of the Apple watch sport which will likely be the most popular version of the Apple watch so I received these two components here from the legendary Sonny Dixon and as you can see they represent both Apple watch sizes the 42 millimeter as well as the 38 millimeters now the Apple watch sport version does not feature a sapphire coated display or glass instead it's using a new product potentially new or rebranded product from Apple called ion X glass now this ion X glass claims to be significantly harder and more durable than standard glass somewhere in the neighborhood of Gorilla Glass some are even speculating that this ion X glass is just a rebranded version of Gorilla Glass that Apple has been using on,0.06,621.843,138.45000000000002
Unbox Therapy,ORIQXujC2v8,Watch,Apple,devices for a long time that said it's nowhere near the hardness of sapphire which will be used in the more expensive Apple watches so of course the question concern is will the Apple watch sport stand up - scratching from various materials so in front of me I have a couple of different items in order to experiment now you might be wondering what's with this name ion X well the name is actually referring to the process by which the glass itself is fortified on a molecular level this is what creates this tougher surface layer when compared with normal glass now there are actually a couple of upsides to using this style of glass when compared to something that sapphire coated not only is this cheaper and lighter it's also a little bit more flexible so in theory it should be less prone to shattering when compared with sapphire okay so I have a number of objects in front of me here that would normally concern you if they got near your brand new device or Apple watch for that matter I've got a key a knife some,68.67,621.843,125.44999999999997
Unbox Therapy,ORIQXujC2v8,Watch,Apple,steel wool some sandpaper and some more hardcore sandpaper this one is using aluminum oxide as the abrasive material this should probably do some damage to this glass aluminum oxide okay so first up we're going to try out the least dangerous of the items I'll be testing this is a simple key for a mailbox I believe so let's go ahead and attempt to scratch up this 42 millimeter face alright I'll push as hard as I can here pretty impressive so far absolutely no scratching more fingerprints than anything else okay a key is not going to be sharp enough hard enough to scratch this ion X material there you go next up we have my trusty little knife here let's go ahead and check this out probably scratch my table long before I'll scratch this surface no not at all just sliding right on top absolutely no problem inspect this again nothing nothing from the knife either so let's step the game up and move on to the steel wool not a chance steel wool better go back to washing dishes son,131.73,621.843,187.04000000000002
Unbox Therapy,ORIQXujC2v8,Watch,Apple,next up the first sandpaper whoo now that seems like we are making some progress here yes indeed ladies and gentlemen now I want to give a shout out real quick to my good friend mkbhd about a year ago he stepped the scratch game up with some sandpaper on what was the original iPhone 6 display set in the benchmark for scratch tests but this is demolishing yeah scratching it up like crazy see it there so yeah with some sandpaper we're definitely scratching it up let's go ahead and grab the hardcore sandpaper oh god listen to that noise okay now we are completely marked up I'm gonna put this orange back underneath so you can see that we are completely marked up there now something to note here if we were dealing with pure sapphire neither of these two surfaces these two sand papers would be capable of scratching it so as suspected ion X material the Gorilla Glass like material nowhere near as scratch resistant as sapphire we didn't expect any different and it's on a $350 watch compared with some of the far more expensive ones in,232.99,621.843,165.45999999999998
Unbox Therapy,ORIQXujC2v8,Watch,Apple,order to get into the sapphire coating you'll be looking at the much more expensive Apple watch or watch Edition don't keep sandpaper near your brand-new Apple watch sport or Apple watch for that matter but as you can see it did very well against keys and knives and certainly coins so in everyday usage this will not necessarily be how he watch turns out that said when you're talking about longevity there is a reason why watch manufacturers have been using sapphire crystal for a very long time if you look at any expensive watch the vast majority of expensive watches have a sapphire crystal and those things can go scratch free for 15 plus years so there you have it all right guys that wraps up this video I hope you appreciated it if you did make sure to leave a thumbs up down below also as mentioned I've got an Apple watch shipping to myself on Friday so expect some coverage on the device as soon as it arrives if you're not a subscriber go ahead and click that button so you don't miss out on any of this new or exclusive content thanks again for watching and I'll catch you on the next episode later,318.2,621.843,125.90999999999998
Unbox Therapy,Ke6-hZ16s-0,Watch,Samsung,oh now I am really happy that Samsung continues to push forward the foldable because we are desperate for these new looks and new takes if you spend any amount of time in like like this experience of having all this real estate oh that's because this is one of the one of the true under display situations wow oh what's called cream it does actually look kind of appetizing almost so I like the modern look to it on the back modern shapes we got all the new stuff yes exciting day it is the Z flip three five G and a z-fold three five G it is not just these retail units in front of me my goodness I got everything it's all the colors it's like look at this a greenish tone and the lavender thing that got Kirk quite excited even with the big one as far as the big one's concerned like we got this color what is this it's uh some type of silver Phantom silver cause Willie dues on Deck just right over there behind the laptop he just finished eating a sandwich which means that he's fired right up and then we have this one right here which is uh apparently some type of green it's almost black I like those deep greens what's this one called Phantom green just stick with the Phantom you'll be all set it doesn't stop there we also have the watches Galaxy watch 4 classic and Galaxy watch for the Galaxy buds 2 the S Pen Pro and and then the S Pen over here which fits into the case now this was rumored and look it happened S Pen input on Z fold three this is what a lot of people wanted and it is official so why don't we kick it off with the z-fold three 5G every so often there's one that comes across that it'll get you going because it's kind of the reason you got into the business to be excited by new things new gadgets new ways of looking at something and that's where the fold lives for me because the very first generation came out this one right over here and immediately I knew something was up something was different now we're on the third generation they continue to make improvements to it ipx8 you have Gorilla Glass victus on here the pen input now snapdragon Triple Eight is going to be in there 12 gigs of RAM is going to be in there Flagship status inside this box is going to be Phantom black and right away you know it's not your typical smartphone it's already and it's folded out State and this is a huge display to work with 7.6 inches on the inside and then of course that exterior display 6.2 inches a slight increase in PPI as well that's where you're going to get your Gorilla Glass uh victus hmm now I am really happy that Samsung continues to push forward the foldable because we are desperate for these new looks and new takes so it's a very deep black and you can see it contrasted against the display over here now the camera layout changed a little bit sort of fits in with the rest of the lineup so you have 12 megapixels across the board here and then you have some optical zoom in there as well at 2x let's go ahead and just do our initial fold here so still so very satisfying here you can see the black hinge as well the device got lighter you know it's a relatively large device that's the point of it right it's meant to fold out and be kind of a productivity monster if you need to launch for example a desktop version of a browser no problem 7.6 inches but it meant that when you were using it as a regular phone it was kind of heavy but they were able to trim that back 271 grams on the new model 279 grams so we're shaving grams and that's tough to do from an engineering standpoint that's going to be a little bit of paperwork also a Sim tool is in there a type c cable to get it charged up the days of power bricks are over this is your Phantom black this one is the green and when you set them side by side now you can start to appreciate how green this is or how black this other one is I'm probably partial to Black still but as far as greens go that's a nice little subtle one Phantom silver over here so this is your lighter variant which has a little bit of color shift to it so that just gives you an idea of the differences there so you're going to get 12 gigs of RAM no matter which version you get you're either going to get 256 gigs of storage or 512 you're gonna get a 4 400 milliamp hour battery it's now starting at 17.99 in the US and 2269 dollars in Canada yes it is still a premium price tag but it is obviously a premium phone it's got the premium spec sheet and it happens to be one of the very few foldable devices to choose from so the price tag kind of fits here it's truly doing two things and getting a a little tablet and a smartphone in one this is the case that houses the pen and this just inserts like this it's like a wallet style case and it allows you to store your pen so that's what the form factor looks like if you want to go this route I'm more inclined towards keeping the case uh slim uh we're also of course going to have a later case that we're going to put out for that device we have the version here for the z-fold two this is about as thin as it can possibly get we're also going to have it available right now while you're watching this to pre-order for the z-fold three so go check that out let's move on to the Z flip three the Z flip in general is not something that I spent a tremendous amount of time with but it is an exciting form factor this one actually caught Kirk's attention he's like I don't know maybe I should be uh flipping I know famously My Pal Austin Evans loves this particular device this is the portability Advantage this thing when it's folded down is Tiny in the pocket,0.96,621.843,719.161
Unbox Therapy,Ke6-hZ16s-0,Watch,Samsung,and I can tell right away it's lighter weight when you have it in the traditional foam form factor it kind of feels like a regular smartphone that just so happens to fold all right so what is this color called will oh it's called cream it does actually look kind of appetizing almost so I like the modern look to it on the back modern shapes when you hold it like this like I said it really feels like a typical foam maybe even lighter than some other non-folding devices with a similar form factor this is super comfy to hold up take a phone call and then just quickly you quickly fold it down I gotta improve my fold game oh there we go that's starting to starting to come back to me now there's something so satisfying about physically folding and then when you go for the pocket test on this it's tiny in the pocket you hardly notice it's there compared to some of these monster smartphones we're carrying so when it comes to portability that's a true advantage to the flip over the fold now when you're unfolded obviously you have a little bit less room to work with well quite a bit and that's where this device comes in that's why my preference is the larger one a huge OLED display to watch content on that's where this one shines but on the go this one here is going to be tough to beat 6.7 inches obviously the aspect ratio is a little bit different so this one is taller which helps make it comfortable to hold so as far as the processor goes we're still looking at top tier specification Snapdragon Triple Eight whether you go flip or if you go fold this is cream we also have a greenish color it's kind of more of an emerald what are they calling this well just green straight up green keep it simple and easy for myself and then we have another lavender like color this one is quite flowery and vibrant obviously we have some differences here triple camera setup on the fold double camera setup on the flip so we have 12 megapixels times two so on this one we're lacking the optical zoom but the whole thing is so slender it kind of makes sense as far as unlocking the device it's similar on both you place your thumb in this location over here you have volume up above that so to unlock it it's a very sort of natural spot and it's also the button that you're going to use to power the device inside the package here it's going to be identical yeah we've got our USB type c Cable in there as well if you head to samsung.com you're going to see the entire selection of color availability so the Z flip 3 is going to start at 999 dollars so it's going to be a little bit more budget friendly as well and in Canadian dollars you're looking at 12.59 to start so you've got eight gigs of RAM here you're either going to get 128 gigs of storage or 256 gigs of storage I almost forgot about this yes front-facing cameras so on the fold you have the exterior front-facing camera but then you also have the interior front-facing camera with the sort of hole punch setup right there and then on the Z flip same idea we have this tiny little hole punch right over here this is 10 megapixels on both the devices so the cover camera on the exterior of the fold is going to be 10 megapixels then the under display camera on the inside of the z-fold 3 that's going to be four megapixels oh that's because this is one of the one of the true under display situations wow it kind of hides the front-facing camera ever so slightly so it's a little bit you know less offensive than having a hole punch that's pretty wild so I got both the devices booted up set up now and this is what they're gonna look like in their uh folded down flipped down kind of uh form factor you can see man this thing is almost like half the size when it's folded down and then what's funny is when you I don't know how funny it is but when you unfold this they're almost the same form factor on the exterior but then this one has the next level to it obviously you go like this and this is the thing that I've missed I can't wait to get back to and get the SIM card back in because this is just it's a lot of fun I mean you just boot up some YouTube or something if you spend any amount of time in like like this experience of having all this real estate and let me just show you what I'm talking about with the audio listen to this this kind of viewing experience right here on the OLED [Music] I mean it really feels like you've got a tablet a tablet that can also go in your pocket and also be a phone if you need it to and it's really it's truly unique in that sense look at this I mean I know I realize you can do multitasking under the phones but you just don't have the form factor to truly take advantage of it if I flip back fold back into this orientation then I have comments so I can be watching up top looking at comments down below when it comes to content consumption this thing truly comes into its own oh I see how they're doing it so the camera area is still the location where you're keeping you know your clock and your battery life and things like this so tabs will open up underneath that portion but if I go this way that's where the front-facing camera no longer becomes a significant obstruction previously you would have had a a giant hole punch there but now with this new tech instead it just looks like sort of a little tiny grid pattern but I think over time you're basically you're going to stop even noticing that and it's going to be less of a distraction than the hole punch would be so it's cool to see this technology implemented especially in a device like this which is so centered on content consumption and immersion as far as fancy tricks go on this one if I did the,370.62,621.843,693.6389999999999
Unbox Therapy,Ke6-hZ16s-0,Watch,Samsung,same task open up YouTube it's obviously a much different experience here because if I go scroll I mean I can still have a video and scroll here that's super tall the video portion itself is quite small but if I it also depends on the aspect ratio of the video keep that in consideration the this show is 16x9 look at the expression right there what a pause that's quite a pause look at the expression so the best part here is you get big smartphone experience but you can do this you can just bam and have a tiny smartphone in your pocket big smartphone experience tiny smartphone in the pocket this is small tablet experience and regular size smartphone in the pocket the last time that I use this device as the daily driver I noticed I ended up using this display a lot when I was out and then when I had a little bit like a moment to relax or something or I needed to get more comprehensive stuff done then I'm going to this display here and it was a huge improvement over the first generation when they went with the bigger exterior display which truly made it function like a typical smartphone with a typical screen size without the need to unfold it okay now another thing that struck me pretty much right away especially when comparing this model to the previous generation is how much work Samsung has done on the hinge mechanism so obviously uh a big component the most important component on a folding device is this hinge that makes it all possible and of course we've seen the exploded views and ask them how many individual pieces and a variety of mechanical aspects how much of that goes into this hinge section but I noticed right away when opening and closing this thing it is absolutely A Step Above what was happening on the previous model this one now can stop at any point so it's a little bit less flimsy and feels more robust through its entirety of opening and closing it reminds me of one of these car doors that you would have on like a luxury vehicle that can stop at any point as opposed to continuing to swing to only like two or three points along the way and I'm wondering if this new construction has anything to do with this enhanced IP rating as well that they've been able to put into this device and then also like where does that play into the overall weight of the device because somehow they were able to create a more satisfying and solid feeling hinge but then they were also able to drop the weight ever so slightly so that's kind of a nice combination it just feels to me like you're dealing with a device that is not first generation anymore you're dealing with a device here where they have learned from the previous models and taken what they've learned and then applied it and that's the nice thing about new form factors there's so much room to grow and to figure things out as you have success along the way and I do expect Samsung to continue to have success with this model because now you've also got the pen input to go with it which is something that a lot of people wanted and could be a compelling characteristic like a compelling feature for them to step up to it now as far as that front-facing camera this image here is kind of probably the best illustration you can get as to how it hides when you're looking at it straight on but then it's kind of still there if you're really looking for it the video over emphasizes the existence of it but I would say at first glance here it is Improvement and less distracting than the hole punch equivalent now some of those hinge characteristics apply to the flip model as well which you're looking at right here and of course this also has this secondary external display for some basic information but you can see just how solid this hinge design is across the entire range of motion now this device I never spent a lot of time with the previous model maybe that will change with this model because there is something satisfying about this form factor as well and especially when it comes to single-handed usage it feels really light in my hand even more so than devices that don't fold at all it has this kind of Slender feeling to it and because it's mostly tall and narrow one-handed text input is super easy to do so if you're one of these people that's always on the go this could be the foldable for you uh I don't know for me it's just such a tough choice because I I'm compelled by by that large screen the ability to have a tablet in your pocket when you need to get even more stuff done but these do have their set of similarities when it comes to the way that you unlock them the big thumb print on the side and of course the vibrant OLED that's the other benefit here in order to get foldable you you're working with OLED to begin with and Samsung has figured that out a long time ago they have some of the most pleasing screens and as you've seen from this imagery here these things pop absolutely tons of color lots of contrast those deep blacks and so on and so that's another appealing component whether it's a foldable or not a foldable [Music] foreign [Music] but just look how portable this thing is once it's folded up in clamshell mode appealing for somebody who is going out wants to throw it in their purse or in their pocket it's uh it's really there's not a lot on the market that's quite like it as far as the camera options go you still have a lot of camera versatility it might not be quite to the same extent as something like the S21 Ultra but it's almost there so you can see some of the zoom capabilities here at the 2x of course you're going to have your portrait modes built into there well it's the Samsung camera app so whatever,721.079,621.843,700.0679999999999
Unbox Therapy,Ke6-hZ16s-0,Watch,Samsung,you're used to seeing you're going to find it here as well including uh this fine moment sentimental moment between Kirk and Kovu yes it's capable of capturing such things [Music] there's also going to be a night mode built in there this is a super early preliminary test but you're gonna find it to be comparable with the rest of the Galaxy lineup so two very cool devices but not the only stuff that Samsung has announced launched today we also have the new watches as well and I have the retail packaging here so let's go ahead and do the unboxing Galaxy watch 4 classic Galaxy watch 4. this classic is in Black so this is a 46 millimeter stainless steel case you can see the sensors in the back military standard 810 G GPS 5 ATM and Gorilla Glass DX 20 millimeter band on it this has a rugged kind of military look to it and on my wrist I you know I like this sizing might as well take advantage get the bigger display on there plus you feel like you have something substantial that you're wearing they do make it in different sizes in fact I have one with a silver white layout over here if you want a smaller size but the classic looks still oh how satisfying very satisfying I might get stuck doing that anyway yeah so if you want the classic look but with a smaller scale you can do that to 42 millimeters the watch 4 is a slightly different style to it compared to the classic so this one is going to be lighter weight this is the 40 millimeter and then over here with the White Band I have the 44 and 40. the silver model you can see here you have the black front large display ratio and then the silver bars on the side that kind of looks cool am I crazy yes so this is what your charger is going to look like the USB type A on one side and then um a magnetic connector I presume let me just peel this off very simple and Sleek no pins nothing like that it just Clips right on very nice the watch band has this quick release style over here as far as the buttons go you have a red indicator on the top button they're tactile so they have a nice springy click to them of a video we got going on here on this classic model with the White Band we have a leather band the classic Model here that I was saying was sort of military styling this one has like a rubberized band similar but slightly different from the watch 4 over here this is also rubberized and so is this a white model right here might be partial to this one but just if I had the black band on it the watch four I'm sure I can get that in Black yes we have green and pink gold as well I don't have those ones here but yeah you have the difference between aluminum construction on the regular model and then the classic Model this is stainless steel so that's why it feels uh more robust if you if you kind of like that weighty sort of quality feel to it features an exynos w920 chip 1.5 gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of internal storage oh baby here are the sensors packed in accelerometer barometer gyro sensor geomagnetic sensor light sensor Samsung bioactive sensor Optical heart rate sensor electrical heart sensor also known as an ECG and bioelectrical impedance analysis Bia these are full out Health devices these days 2021. yeah the crown is your input method actually well on this model you simply move between your screens with this tactile click it's quite satisfying if you haven't tried it before now of course you can also just touch the screen because it's a touch screen so if you don't have this bezel like on these other models then that's how you're going to interact with it you're right it has like a digital wow and almost does it make a noise very slight noise so this one has a haptic version of the physical click I probably partial to the physical click myself but if you felt like you were missing out you're not you're gonna get the digital equivalent on the non-classic model so many options to choose from which is great especially in the watch category where everybody wants to personalize what they've got and use it in different ways at this moment if I had to pick between these four I'd probably go for this classic Model the larger classic Model myself this is just far too satisfying using this alright so I want to talk a little bit more about the S Pen real quick so I have this z-fold pro model here now it is a different pen for these the fold right this it says right on it fold Edition now I presume that has something to do with the nub oh they've definitely reformulated the nub I'm just looking at it right now that is your full version of the nub it's the same on this uh Z fold the pro model as it is on just to fold Edition this is the smaller of the two that fits into the case this is if you're getting real serious and there's a little switch a physical switch it's also just physically bigger or what oh cool look how you charge it up on the ends little cap and type c charger this one doesn't need to charge very cool all right so a couple of different options for you there now let's actually try out the input so if I open this up let's see what goes on here oh it's oh that's it it's just working

listen listen oh so satisfying I actually thought it was the pen on the screen no no no no no no no no it's the speaker but it's very satisfying so kind of like how an electric car will have a some sort of sound feedback to help you realize you're doing something this is the equivalent of such things wow last up item the Galaxy buds 2 clear enriched sound with two-way speakers active noise canceling comfortable fit and 5 to 20 hours of play time there we go very nice the container in glossy white LED light on the front USB type c on the back to charge it up and USB cable included in the

experience you know a little bit of magic it's not old on me yet I'll tell you that right now I know when the first version came I was like whoa wow it's really folding exciting times it doesn't have to be another slab the imagination is alive and Technology you can do something different you can flip you can fold it's up to you it's cool let me put the SIM card in actually before I do that let me show you I got a giant box of accessories so you can even make whatever you want out of this thing holy look at this flip case with some style and you can hook it on to something of course we got the silicone covers we got a cover with like a keychain style ring on it maybe you want to have this uh so many to choose from oh here's the leather flip cover this seems to have like a little handle on

deals I show up I'm like I'm ready to make a deal I brought my leather today let me just do the crazy case that Kirk was showing off check this look out this look here is no joke how about this for a

CNET,48GuLaevzsQ,Watch,Apple,[Music] I'm taking a break from The Busy floor at CES 2024 to take a look at this the Segway go-kart Pro 2 it's part go-kart part self-balancing bot part game controller let's take a closer [Music] look so what segue has done is they've taken the motortech technology from their self-balancing robots and put it in the back of this cart and the result is a whole lot of fun it's very Zippy the steering is very direct and because you're so close to the ground it's just extremely engaging now we've got three different modes eco mode limits me to about 5 mph sport lets me get up to around 11 and in race mode you got a top,0.37,621.843,82.75900000000001
CNET,48GuLaevzsQ,Watch,Apple,speed of around 26.7 mph and enough torque that you can actually hang the back of this thing out and have a little bit of fun drifting it's been a whole lot of fun and the steering is pretty much what you would expect from a cart uh it's very direct and it's very fun to drive I'm just having a blast out here zipping around on the course now the cart chassis has a little bit of adjustability for taller or shorter Riders I'm a little bit on the extreme end of what you could fit in here but it's a whole lot of fun to drive around but when the weather gets bad you don't have to stop enjoying yourself you can actually bring it inside and I'll show you how that works,49.32,621.843,69.28
CNET,48GuLaevzsQ,Watch,Apple,now so when you bring the card into the house you can actually connect it to your gaming console using a little dongle like this and that will allow you to transform the cart into a racing simulator rig so here I am playing a game on the screen and my steering wheel and my pedals work just like they would if I were out on the track however I have the added benefit of haptic feedback here so if I run into this telephone pole for example I'll actually feel the base of the seat vibrate and that adds a little bit of extra immersion which could be the edge in winning a race now I promised you three modes and this is the third with just two screws,85.92,621.843,77.759
CNET,48GuLaevzsQ,Watch,Apple,and some bcro straps you can remove the motor unit from the cart and convert it into a self-balancing robo hovercraft now I've never been on one of these before believe it or not so my friend David at segue is going to make sure that I don't injure myself here so you go into the app and you put it into self- balancing mode and then you just hop on little wobbly there but here we go I'm on you lean forward to go forward and whoo who you lean backwards to go back I think I'm getting the hang of it lean to the left to turn L to the right to turn so this is the third mode and you,124.92,621.843,82.402
CNET,48GuLaevzsQ,Watch,Apple,can actually use this to get around when you're not just scooting or playing video games which actually adds a little bit more practicality to buying the whole package here we go oh it's a lot easier when you're not just trying to stand around in Balance once you get moving oh yeah I'm feeling it so yeah maybe I'm a little too big for this thing but for kids just getting into racing simulation or carting I think this could be a great way to introduce them to both be sure to head over to cet.com where you can learn more about the rest of Segway micromobility products and the rest of the cool things happening over at CES 2024 I'll see you there,170.48,621.843,86.64200000000001
CNET,NhUKTvkAe1I,Watch,Apple,there are so many ways that Apple watch and its Health sensors can help you make a fresh start in the new year and yet apple has a few things it needs to resolve to do this year if it wants to keep selling its smart watches apple is kicking off 2024 by dealing with a messy patent infringement case over the blood oxygen sensors in the Apple watch to catch you up to speed during the week of Christmas Apple was ordered to stop selling some models of the watch because of patent infringement but a few days later the watch is went back on sale when Apple appealed Apple could face more drama in the coming days it's not over yet what happens next depends on decisions from the International Trade Commission and how a court rules on apples appeal this battle is bigger than a single pulse oximeter patent let's get to the heart of what matters to you and what it means for the future of the Apple watch I'm Bridget KY and this is one more thing Apple is very much a health focused company right now and it,0.48,621.843,116.95900000000002
CNET,NhUKTvkAe1I,Watch,Apple,all centers in in on the wrist with the Apple watch Apple watches can track your heart health and give life-saving warnings Apple watch checks for unusually higher low heart rates or a regular rhythm you can take an ECG reading from your wrist the watch can tell if there's changes in your body temperature when you're sleeping there's also fall detection to call 911 but the feature getting all the attention these days is the optical heart sensor that measures blood oxygen levels it's a measurement that can clue you into potential breathing ISS issues and it's the focus of a legal battle with health tech company masimo a US judge ruled that apple had infringed on masimo patents related to the technology used in Apple's blood oxygen sensing system and the US International Trade Commission it issued an order that prohibited Apple from importing the series 9 and the ultra 2 models of the watch which have this feature Apple restarted sales of both of these watches,58.68,621.843,115.28100000000002
CNET,NhUKTvkAe1I,Watch,Apple,a few days after an appeals court paused the sales ban and there are a few things happening right now while Apple tries to keep the watch from being banned again as the Fight Continues Apple said in a statement that it is working on changes to the watches it said Apple strongly disagrees with the itc's decision in addition to the appeal at the US court of appeals for the federal circuit apple is vigorously pursuing legal and Technical options to ensure that we can continue to provide customers with Apple Watch series 9 and Apple watch Ultra 2 including having submitted a proposed redesigned Apple Watch series 9 and Apple watch Ultra 2 for US Customs approval add to all of that a Bloomberg report that says Apple has been working on software changes to the blood oxygen detection feature but the dispute is over Hardware patents so how could a software change fix it maybe if Apple argues that it's the software that controls how the hardware functions meanwhile Apple's also fighting to keep,116.6,621.843,125.36
CNET,NhUKTvkAe1I,Watch,Apple,the Apple watch on sale for this entire appeals process even if the software fix is not good enough for Regulators right now it's possible that Apple watch could be sold during the legal battle or the court could reinstate the ban and no surprise I am seeing a bunch of discounts right now on Apple watches because who knows what the future holds maybe masimo and apple will have talks for a settlement or go into some sort of Licensing agreement it's even possible Apple could just take a few months to change up the watch hardware and put it back on sale later we'll have to wait and see this news may feel like it came out of the blue but the patent infringement battle with masimo has been going on for 3 years now Bloomberg has a good timeline if you want to read up more on how we got here and the Wall Street Journal has been covering the drama in depth with interviews with the CEO of masimo but however this case goes it could shape the future of Apple watch development apple is moving fast on,179.48,621.843,111.63899999999998
CNET,NhUKTvkAe1I,Watch,Apple,making sure it has cuttingedge Health sensors in its upcoming Apple watches and when you move fast it's entirely possible Apple made butt heads with more Healthcare tech companies when it comes to patents maybe for upcoming blood glucose monitoring or blood pressure sensors lots of companies are racing to get an edge in this space right now next week there won't be a usual one more thing episode for me because I will be covering some of that Cutting Edge Health Tech at CES the big Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas you're going to find me on this channel talking about all sorts of cool things I find where among them of course Apple wants the wrist to be the key to your health it's fun to see how other tech companies also see what the future holds for our wrists and health tracking so stay tuned and we'll see if the Apple watches are still on sale for the next episode or maybe we'll find some new tech we want Apple to put in its future watches without infringing patents of course catch you next time,235.2,621.843,118.99900000000001

CNET,4hI314YO5mg,Watch,Google,the pixel Watch 2 is the upgrade I've been waiting for for the most part it doesn't get everything right but Google does fill in many of the gaps that the first one was missing the pixel Watch 2 has automatic workout detection a smoother crown for scrolling an impressively accurate heart rate sensor and the same stress tracking features found on the Fitbit sense 2 the pixel Watch 2 gains a few new exercise tools you can now set goals based on heart rate zones and pace with the watch alerting you when you move in and out of those Targets this could be useful if you're training for a race although these features aren't as robust as some of the running tools you get on a proper sports watch like those made by Garmin but for me it was just enough to encourage me to pick up the pace when I was falling behind on my run however keep in mind that Google's website does say that these features are coming to the original pixel watch soon so don't upgrade just for these features alone Google also says that pixel Watch 2 can measure heart rate more more accurately thanks to a new algorithm and the watch's multi-path sensors I tried this by testing the pixel Watch 2 against a polar chest strap and I have to say the results were impressive the,1.76,621.843,139.48
CNET,4hI314YO5mg,Watch,Google,pixel Watch 2 was only a beat or two off in most cases and sometimes it even matched the polar chest strap beat for beat if you're anything like me you probably forget to end the workout on your watch when you're finished most smart watches know this and can automatically detect when a workout is finished and prompt you to end it this was a major shortcoming of the first pixel watch but luckily Google has fixed it this time around the pixel Watch 2 can automatically detect certain workouts like walking running and treadmill and prompt you to start or stop a workout as needed this worked for me both when walking outside and on the treadmill the pixel Watch 2 has several Health sensors and these generally behave the same way they do in Fitbit smart watches that's to say that they factor into overall health readings rather than being used for spot checks for example skin temperature is one metric that Fitbit looks at when it's detecting possible signs of stress and blood oxygen factors into your sleep readings speaking of stress the pixel Watch 2 has the same stress tracking features as the Fitbit sense 2 that means it can passively monitor for body responses throughout the day it does this by combining readings from a,71.4,621.843,132.4

CNET,4hI314YO5mg,Watch,Google,activated I found these claims to generally be pretty accurate since it lasted more than 24 hours with the always on display on but keep in mind that was a relatively light day when I didn't record any workouts but on a more demanding day when I ran outdoors with the GPS active the battery drained much more quickly I really wish Google could find a way to make the pixel watch's battery last even longer but Google did at least speed up the amount of time it takes to charge your pixel watch the pixel Watch 2 replenished 97% of its battery in an hour while the first pixel watch only replenished 81% of its battery in the same time that's basically a full charge from 0% to Almost 100% in just an hour the pixel Watch 2 has the same Sleek design as the first model making it one of the best looking smart watches around even though it has an aluminum design instead of the first one stainless steel look I don't necessarily mind this because it's really the pixel watch's curved glass that makes it stand out but the same thick black bezels are still present on the second model you won't notice these most of the time but if you're using an app or a watch face that doesn't have a black background you can see them overall the pixel Watch 2 is,207.48,621.843,149.118

CNET,ZMa5f8nZjTs,Watch,Google,spend time with it before I know if it lives up to Google's Promises at the heart of the pixel Watch 2 is its new heart rate sensor it has multiple contact points enabling it to get a better signal but should result in more accurate readings and that's important because a lot of fitbits other features like active Zone minutes rely on heart rate the watch can also send an alert when you enter certain heart rate zones and running Paces during your workout which might be useful if you're training for a race Google is also bringing more familiar Fitbit features to the pixel Watch 2 including stress and temperature tracking like the Fitbit sense 2 the pixel Watch 2 can measure,40.64,621.843,78.759

CNET,dVPKkPnd0iA,Watch,Google,the pixel watch is Google's ultimate Android Smartwatch and it's pretty great but how does it compare to the Samsung Galaxy watch 5 the other king of Android watches both run wear OS have a round display and work with pretty much every Android phone we'll be breaking down the differences in the screens the health sensors battery life and more to help you decide between the two now your first decision might come down to price and size the Galaxy watch 5 starts at 279 US dollars for the 40 millimeter version or 309 for the 44 millimeter version while the pixel watch is only in one 41 millimeter size and starts at 349 for your information I'm wearing the 40 millimeter Galaxy watch 5 in this video you can also spend a little bit extra on both to get an LTE or cellular option that lets you use the watch away from the phone and still get calls and messages links to all the latest pricing and chapters are in the description for you but without any further Ado let's get into it pixel Galaxy more or less game on [Music] yes these are both round watches but they really are like chalk and cheese in many other respects the pixel watch has curved edges a Sleek wristwatch look with a crown and a side button the Galaxy watch 5 has a flat screen with two side buttons now which one is going to be more comfortable on your wrist well that will depend on things like the size of your wrist as well as of course your personal style elegant and Sleek or utilitarian and practical now for me my wrist is 152 millimeters so that's pretty small and the pixel watch I think definitely looks and feels better especially if I'm doing sleep tracking overnight it's much more comfortable but it might be too small for some wrists and I like having options with the Galaxy watch 5 even if I don't think it's as comfortable overall then there's the question of bezel versus bezel now both watches have one and it's really going to depend on the watch face you use as to whether or not you notice it or not the bezel on the Galaxy watch 5 does have one extra trick though it is a touch bezel so you can move your finger around it to navigate and scroll through menu options I kind of prefer the crown on the pixel watch I don't think it's as fussy to use and I don't have to be as precise with my movements don't get me wrong I still miss the physical rotating bezel from older Galaxy watches but hey this isn't the time or the place or the video so I'm just gonna go pull one out over there now a physical dial is obviously easier to control as well if your hands,0.0,621.843,319.76200000000006
CNET,dVPKkPnd0iA,Watch,Google,are sweaty or wet unlike the touch bezel that doesn't really work very well at all if there's any moisture in your hands and speaking of all things damp water resistance is on both and they can track swimming but only the Galaxy watch 5 is officially rated ip68 so that means dust and water resistant the pixel watch is rated for 5 ATM or 50 meters screens beautiful screens both of these watches use OLED displays with a maximum 1000 nits and I've had zero issues seeing either of them in bright sunlight and they can stay always on too which is a nice touch especially if you don't want to keep raising your wrist or tapping the screen but of course battery life is affected when you use the always on and we'll talk about that later and let's get into the bands on the pixel watch there's a little button on the side you can push and then move the strap to detach it and honestly it's just a little bit fiddly I accidentally end up somehow pressing the crown because I don't know fat fingers maybe the Galaxy watch 5 has more traditional spring bars which are honestly just as fiddly but the plus side is you get broader compatibility with 20 millimeter bands watch faces are another way to change the look and feel of your watch and there are not as many first party options on the pixel watch as you'll get on the Galaxy watch but of course there are plenty of third-party options on the Play Store for both and of course there is a speaker and microphone on both of these watches you can do things like take calls dictate messages hear notifications read aloud but only the Galaxy watch 5 lets you play back music from the speaker which is probably one of my it's a feature that no one probably uses except for me but I love it and the fact that I can do that on the Galaxy watch 5. is great so far I think it's actually a pretty Level Playing Field but of course we are not done yet these two watches pretty much do all the basics they track your steps they track calories your sleep and so many different workout types the biggest differences are in some of the health tracking features and the interfaces so the pixel watch really relies heavily on Fitbit for its workout tracking and in the app you'll find all of this information after the fact while the Samsung watch is all found in Samsung Health yes you can use Google fit on both but I don't know why you would really because it's totally subjective but for me overall the Fitbit app is the most easy to use and IT services things in a much nicer way than the Samsung Health app on the flip side though the,160.98,621.843,307.9210000000001
CNET,dVPKkPnd0iA,Watch,Google,Galaxy watch does do things like automatic workout detection for say walks and runs and it is super reliable but for some bizarre reason the pixel watch does not do this even though other fitbits have automatic workout detections like what are you doing Google here's a laundry list of other health features you might want and need the Galaxy watch gives you a bio impedance sensor that measures body composition there's also a blood oxygen sensor and a temperature sensor but that last one isn't active yet at the time recording which is kind of a bummer there's also an ECG app for detecting signs of atrial fibrillation but you also need to have a Samsung phone to use this feature unless you do side load the health monitor app on another Android doable but a bit more work the pixel watch also has an ECG that works on any Android phone as well as blood oxygen tracking but the theme is sensors aren't active at the time of launch and the blood oxygen on the pixel watch is not at least at the time I recorded this I guess Time Heals all wounds the other thing is the pixel watch does not have high and low heart rate alerts and irregular heart rate alerts that the Galaxy watch 5 does they both have GPS built in and that means you don't need to take a phone with you to track workout route information and they both lock onto a signal within about five seconds of being outside which is great the pixel watch though was more accurate in terms of calculating distance when compared to a control phone but things like steps and Pace were all within the same ballpark of each other on both of the watches heart rate sensor accuracy is the other big calling part of the pixel watch and compared to a chest strap it is the watch I choose over the Galaxy watch if I wanted the closest and most accurate results for a cardio workout okay so we have to talk about Fitbit premium now this is the 10 a month subscription service you do get six months free with the pixel watch but it gives you things like workout plans but more importantly it's the in-depth Health metrics like a daily Readiness score and more in-depth sleep tracking data that I find the most valuable you can totally use this watch without the subscription but it is something to keep in mind if you like all of that extra data and I find it really really valuable especially because the pixel watch just gives me more useful information especially about things like recovery which is great if you're trying to train for something and you just want to make sure that you're not over,315.3,621.843,291.479
CNET,dVPKkPnd0iA,Watch,Google,training or conversely under training the Galaxy watch does not need a subscription to unlock any additional data which is great but on the flip side the data it does give you is really just not as in-depth as the pixel watch overall specifically around sleep tracking which is superior on the pixel watch now not only is the Sleep score way more indicative of the quality of my sleep like one night I get a score in the 90s on the pixel and a score in the 70s from the Galaxy watch like who doesn't want to be a star student when it comes to sleep the Galaxy watch just didn't really reflect how good I felt after that night's sleep and the Galaxy watch 5's blood oxygen ratings overnight are just super low I've been wearing this watch since launch and they just haven't got any better yet so I'm still hoping for a software update to improve the accuracy of blood oxygen readings overnight time to talk about battery it's so important for any smart watch and there's always a couple of ways to slice this now results are going to vary depending on how you use the watch but with the always on display active and similar usage patterns on both with notifications turned on and a one hour GPS workout I can get about 21 hours on the Galaxy watch 5 on the smaller version or 20 hours on the pixel watch so generally you'll want to top these up before bed if sleep tracking is your jam now be aware that the pixel watch really eats a lot of battery for sleep tracking and it can drop more than 20 percent overnight with the always-on display off and lighter usage without a GPS workout expect around 24 hours on the Galaxy watch 5 or 26 on the pixel watch now of course if you have the 44 millimeter Galaxy watch 5 that's going to give you a bit more battery in life closer to about 30 hours and I will update my full text comparison with LTE battery of results once that's available Samsung has another trick of its sleeve with reverse wireless charging so you can put the watch on the back of some Samsung phones to top it up which is kind of nice speaking of charging the Galaxy watch 5 goes from Flat to 45 percent in less than 30 minutes and then to full in about one and a half hours the pixel is about 34 minutes to get to 45 and then to get to completely full it will get there in about the same time as the Galaxy watch5 and neither of them come with the fast charging brick that you will need to support the fast charging times because we can't have nice things please just give me a charger in the box alright time for all the other bells and,460.8,621.843,307.201

CNET,dVPKkPnd0iA,Watch,Samsung,are sweaty or wet unlike the touch bezel that doesn't really work very well at all if there's any moisture in your hands and speaking of all things damp water resistance is on both and they can track swimming but only the Galaxy watch 5 is officially rated ip68 so that means dust and water resistant the pixel watch is rated for 5 ATM or 50 meters screens beautiful screens both of these watches use OLED displays with a maximum 1000 nits and I've had zero issues seeing either of them in bright sunlight and they can stay always on too which is a nice touch especially if you don't want to keep raising your wrist or tapping the screen but of course battery life is affected when you use the always on and we'll talk about that later and let's get into the bands on the pixel watch there's a little button on the side you can push and then move the strap to detach it and honestly it's just a little bit fiddly I accidentally end up somehow pressing the crown because I don't know fat fingers maybe the Galaxy watch 5 has more traditional spring bars which are honestly just as fiddly but the plus side is you get broader compatibility with 20 millimeter bands watch faces are another way to change the look and feel of your watch and there are not as many first party options on the pixel watch as you'll get on the Galaxy watch but of course there are plenty of third-party options on the Play Store for both and of course there is a speaker and microphone on both of these watches you can do things like take calls dictate messages hear notifications read aloud but only the Galaxy watch 5 lets you play back music from the speaker which is probably one of my it's a feature that no one probably uses except for me but I love it and the fact that I can do that on the Galaxy watch 5. is great so far I think it's actually a pretty Level Playing Field but of course we are not done yet these two watches pretty much do all the basics they track your steps they track calories your sleep and so many different workout types the biggest differences are in some of the health tracking features and the interfaces so the pixel watch really relies heavily on Fitbit for its workout tracking and in the app you'll find all of this information after the fact while the Samsung watch is all found in Samsung Health yes you can use Google fit on both but I don't know why you would really because it's totally subjective but for me overall the Fitbit app is the most easy to use and IT services things in a much nicer way than the Samsung Health app on the flip side though the,160.98,621.843,307.9210000000001
CNET,dVPKkPnd0iA,Watch,Samsung,Galaxy watch does do things like automatic workout detection for say walks and runs and it is super reliable but for some bizarre reason the pixel watch does not do this even though other fitbits have automatic workout detections like what are you doing Google here's a laundry list of other health features you might want and need the Galaxy watch gives you a bio impedance sensor that measures body composition there's also a blood oxygen sensor and a temperature sensor but that last one isn't active yet at the time recording which is kind of a bummer there's also an ECG app for detecting signs of atrial fibrillation but you also need to have a Samsung phone to use this feature unless you do side load the health monitor app on another Android doable but a bit more work the pixel watch also has an ECG that works on any Android phone as well as blood oxygen tracking but the theme is sensors aren't active at the time of launch and the blood oxygen on the pixel watch is not at least at the time I recorded this I guess Time Heals all wounds the other thing is the pixel watch does not have high and low heart rate alerts and irregular heart rate alerts that the Galaxy watch 5 does they both have GPS built in and that means you don't need to take a phone with you to track workout route information and they both lock onto a signal within about five seconds of being outside which is great the pixel watch though was more accurate in terms of calculating distance when compared to a control phone but things like steps and Pace were all within the same ballpark of each other on both of the watches heart rate sensor accuracy is the other big calling part of the pixel watch and compared to a chest strap it is the watch I choose over the Galaxy watch if I wanted the closest and most accurate results for a cardio workout okay so we have to talk about Fitbit premium now this is the 10 a month subscription service you do get six months free with the pixel watch but it gives you things like workout plans but more importantly it's the in-depth Health metrics like a daily Readiness score and more in-depth sleep tracking data that I find the most valuable you can totally use this watch without the subscription but it is something to keep in mind if you like all of that extra data and I find it really really valuable especially because the pixel watch just gives me more useful information especially about things like recovery which is great if you're trying to train for something and you just want to make sure that you're not over,315.3,621.843,291.479
CNET,dVPKkPnd0iA,Watch,Samsung,training or conversely under training the Galaxy watch does not need a subscription to unlock any additional data which is great but on the flip side the data it does give you is really just not as in-depth as the pixel watch overall specifically around sleep tracking which is superior on the pixel watch now not only is the Sleep score way more indicative of the quality of my sleep like one night I get a score in the 90s on the pixel and a score in the 70s from the Galaxy watch like who doesn't want to be a star student when it comes to sleep the Galaxy watch just didn't really reflect how good I felt after that night's sleep and the Galaxy watch 5's blood oxygen ratings overnight are just super low I've been wearing this watch since launch and they just haven't got any better yet so I'm still hoping for a software update to improve the accuracy of blood oxygen readings overnight time to talk about battery it's so important for any smart watch and there's always a couple of ways to slice this now results are going to vary depending on how you use the watch but with the always on display active and similar usage patterns on both with notifications turned on and a one hour GPS workout I can get about 21 hours on the Galaxy watch 5 on the smaller version or 20 hours on the pixel watch so generally you'll want to top these up before bed if sleep tracking is your jam now be aware that the pixel watch really eats a lot of battery for sleep tracking and it can drop more than 20 percent overnight with the always-on display off and lighter usage without a GPS workout expect around 24 hours on the Galaxy watch 5 or 26 on the pixel watch now of course if you have the 44 millimeter Galaxy watch 5 that's going to give you a bit more battery in life closer to about 30 hours and I will update my full text comparison with LTE battery of results once that's available Samsung has another trick of its sleeve with reverse wireless charging so you can put the watch on the back of some Samsung phones to top it up which is kind of nice speaking of charging the Galaxy watch 5 goes from Flat to 45 percent in less than 30 minutes and then to full in about one and a half hours the pixel is about 34 minutes to get to 45 and then to get to completely full it will get there in about the same time as the Galaxy watch5 and neither of them come with the fast charging brick that you will need to support the fast charging times because we can't have nice things please just give me a charger in the box alright time for all the other bells and,460.8,621.843,307.201

CNET,Qsvl_MdQyng,Watch,Google,the pixel watch is the Apple watch of Android smart watches but it doesn't get everything right just yet let me explain what I mean by that well there are plenty of smart watches many of which that work across Android and iOS there aren't many that have been specifically designed with Android users in mind many of these other cross-platform smart watches like those made by Fitbit Michael Kors Garmin and fossil tend to specialize in Fitness or fashion and struggle to provide a good balance of the two the Apple watch manages to do this well for the most part but of course it's only for iPhone owners now Google is trying to fill that Gap in the Android market with the pixel watch the pixel watch starts at 350 dollars for the Standard Version and costs 400 for the LTE version it launches on October 13th and pre-order started on October 6th with its focus on design and fitness the pixel watch is essentially a hybrid between Fitbit and the Apple watch and I mean that quite literally when it comes to Fitbit since Fitbit is now part of Google many of fitbit's core stats and features are built into the watch overall I think the pixel watch is one of the best if not the best options out there for Android users looking for a new smartwatch but it's relatively short battery life and a few other quirks hold it back from being as good as it can be I have to admit the pixel watch is a lot nicer looking than I expected it has domed glass edges that curve around the sides giving it a more unique look that definitely sets it apart from a lot of other watches the pixel watch comes in matte black polished silver or champagne gold finishes I've been using the Silver version paired with a charcoal active watch band think of the active band as,0.0,621.843,205.73999999999992
CNET,Qsvl_MdQyng,Watch,Google,Google's answer to the Apple watches Sports band there's also a crown similar to the Apple watch's digital Crown which serves as a button and a scroll wheel however the pixel watch only comes in 141 millimeter size option I personally don't mind that since I have a small wrist but it might be a drawback for those who prefer larger watches if you've been reading about the pixel watch lately you've probably heard some of the criticism about the pixel watches large bezels there's good news and bad news the bad news is that yes these bezels do exist but on the bright side they're not very noticeable most of the time many of the pixel watches clock faces and other software elements have a black background making it hard to tell where the screen ends and the bezel begins but you can definitely see how small the pixel watches screen is compared to the rest of the watch when using the photos watch face speaking of watch faces the pixel watch comes with a variety of different styles and you can swap out faces on the watch itself or on the accompanying app on your phone like the Apple watch you can add complications to the watch face that show bits of information like your battery level the weather alarms or an app shortcut I really like the clean look of Google's watch faces but the Apple watch has more variety in terms of design most pixel watch faces are some variation of a clock in either analog or digital form with some complications the Apple watch has more variety when it comes to style with options ranging from animated Flowers and Butterflies to astronomy and Mickey Mouse themed faces [Music] the pixel watch feels like a really nice looking Fitbit watch there's a lot of Fitbit sprinkled throughout the whole,112.2,621.843,205.32
CNET,Qsvl_MdQyng,Watch,Google,software experience not only do you get fitbit's core activity metrics like Steps sleep tracking and calories burned but you also get specific Fitbit features like active Zone minutes which gives you more exercise credit the harder you work in fact the pixel watches software feels a lot like the sense 2 which I was using in the days just before I switched to the pixel watch just like the sense 2 if you swipe down to get your quick settings up to see notifications and left or right to see tiles these tiles show bits of information kind of like smartphone widgets the biggest difference between the pixel watches software and the sense 2s is that you can download Google Play store apps since it runs on Google's Ware OS software that means you can get apps like Spotify the productivity app todoist and map my ride on your wrist just like you can on other wear OS powered watches such as the Samsung Galaxy watch live but there's already plenty of functionality from Fitbit and Google baked right into the software without having to download any apps you get around 40 workout options on your wrist and the Fitbit Exercise app along with fitbit's Today app which shows data points like calories burned active Zone minutes heart rate and more as for Google powered features you get the Google Assistant of course as well as Google Maps and Google's home app for managing smart home devices you can summon the Google Assistant by pushing the side button or by saying the Wake word however it usually took me a few tries to get the pixel watch to detect the Wake word so I've been using the button the software is easy to navigate overall and the pixel watch has most of the features I'm looking for in terms of Smartwatch functionality like the,214.44,621.843,192.48100000000002

CNET,Qsvl_MdQyng,Watch,Google,smooth when scrolling around the operating system or launching apps and it does feel a little faster than the sense too but while the pixel watch has a lot of things in common with Fitbit devices unfortunately battery life is not one of them the pixel watch lasted for about 15 hours with the always-on display activated on a day when I went on a 22 minute outdoor run but that improved significantly when you turn the always-on display off without it I got around 28 hours of battery life but I also didn't go on an outdoor run that day that's important because GPS tracking is known to be a battery drainer the pixel watches battery life might be fine if you plan to charge it every night but it does make it challenging to use as a sleep tracker I'm a little disappointed by the pixel watches battery life because I really enjoy using the always-on display the pixel watch feels like a mashup between Fitbit and the Apple watch which is ultimately a good thing I love the pixel watches elegant design wide variety of exercise types accurate heart rate monitor and attractive watch faces but the battery life isn't as long as I would like it to be especially with the always-on display active and the black bezels framing the screen will seem noticeable if you try to use a watch face that doesn't have a solid black background the pixel watch doesn't really bring anything new to the world of smart watches but it is filling a hole in the market for Android device owners and that's enough for now but I'm excited to see where Google and Fitbit take the pixel watch in the future so what do you think of the pixel watch let us know in the comments and don't forget to subscribe for more smart watch coverage thanks for watching and I'll see you next time foreign [Music],410.039,621.843,190.301
CNET,FnLZ1LVWVAQ,Watch,Google,[Music] if you've been waiting for the future of Android watches while we've come to Brooklyn to check it out the Google pixel watch is coming October 13th and it looks like the most complete and advanced Android smart watch that we've seen in a while now I am also thinking about the Samsung Galaxy watch 4 and 5 which have been part of Samsung and Google's Reinventing of where OS that started last year and Samsung's watch is really fully featured but some of its features do require you to have a Samsung Galaxy phone the pixel watch is going for a universal type of clean design and most importantly it's a partnership with Fitbit which by the way Google owns Fitbit has not been on an Android watch before like it's been on the pixel watch this is part of what will be an ongoing series of products really the future of Fitbit where the pixel watch at 350 dollars sits at the top end of fitbit's product line but also represents a true smartwatch Fitbit did have a smart watch that came out just a short while ago the Versa 4 and also the sense 2. its smart watches have had its own apps and watch faces and they're going to continue on for iOS,0.12,621.843,145.91000000000003
CNET,FnLZ1LVWVAQ,Watch,Google,compatibility as well the pixel watch is Android only and its features are meant to take advantage of the Google Play Store and Android and a lot of the similar types of features in design it's a round watch and it looks really sharp it's got a domed gorilla glass display and it has a stainless steel casing the whole look of it is very Sleek next to an Apple Watch series 8. it's kind of similarly small and elegant looking I really like the circular look the one thing is that there's a bit of a bezel around the display which gets hidden because a lot of the watch faces and the interface have a very minimalist look kind of like previous Apple watches that went for mostly black with colors layered on top the look looks really sharp though the watch strap perhaps look really nice and there are a variety of them they also attach in a different way they sort of slide on and click it's meant to be easier to put on it took a little a few moments for me to understand it there's also a haptic response in the digital Crown which is similar to the Apple watch you can feel this clicking movement that's very satisfying now as far as features go this has got all the stuff that you'd,74.1,621.843,135.059
CNET,FnLZ1LVWVAQ,Watch,Google,expect out of a basic premium smart watch it's got a very accurate sounding heart rate monitor which Fitbit is boasting pings once a second that's a much faster ping rate than are on other smart watches and it's more equivalent to what you get on an everyday Fitbit so that heart rate sensor could be worth it on its own the battery life will be about 24 hours so it still should last a good chunk of time but not as long as other Fitbit watches it also has ECG which is something that I didn't expect to see but ECG will check to see if your atrial fibrillation is out of whack and that's something we've seen on other watches before it also has some features like GPS a compass eventually it'll get updated for blood oxygen and fall detection what it does not have Fitness wise are some of the more advanced sensors that we've seen on other Fitbit watches like the sense the Fitbit sense 2 has the ability to detect possible stress through uh to checking sweat levels the different type of sensor and it also has body temperature which is something that Apple introduced on the Apple Watch series 8. temperature is not on this watch but it looks like the way Fitbit is looking at this watch is a way,142.26,621.843,145.8
CNET,FnLZ1LVWVAQ,Watch,Google,to eventually have future sensors make it to this over time there are things that you still can take advantage of in the Fitbit landscape Readiness scores sleep scores these types of General Wellness scores will be available on the pixel watch making it effectively a full Fitbit which is encouraging now there is some stuff still with the Google Fit landscape that's not really meant for Fitbit you have these two different Fitness platforms or health platforms it's still supporting Google fit but Fitbit is really where you want to be with this watch and Fitbit premium is a subscription service that costs extra you can get six months free if you get the pixel watch which is similar to what other fitbits have but just keep in mind it I think it's kind of an essential feature and you will have to pay extra to make the most of that the pixel watch can be upgraded to 400 for a cellular version that's interesting because there's been no cellular Fitbit before four dollars is not a terrible price 350 400 basically falls into a premium Smartwatch territory and Falls definitely less expensive of where a lot of the Apple,215.34,621.843,129.18
CNET,FnLZ1LVWVAQ,Watch,Google,watches climb up too we haven't done a full review of this watch yet but using it for just a few moments here in a demo room uh it looks really nice the display looks crisp the Fitbit interface is very familiar and the watch faces that I went through were all pretty fun to play with what else do we think about this you're gonna have to wait and see for our full review the pixel watch does seem like a whole new step forward for Android watches but also keep in mind that the chipset in this is a Samsung exynos processor not a tensor processor the reasons for this we don't know but at this point that's part of the package deal we may see further Evolutions in where the pixel watch goes over time this is only the First Watch in the series but I think that this could represent for other watchmakers a way to maybe have a platform to build Fitbit onto other types of watches that have Android capability we don't know about that yet but it seems promising what do you think about this watch is this something that you'd like to wear do you like the design do you use Fitbit let me know in the comments below thanks a lot for watching and make sure to like And subscribe and we'll be back soon with a full review [Music],279.78,621.843,144.75900000000001
CNET,U4dE-OqDG-8,Watch,Google,[Music] google's got a whole new smart watch the pixel watch is real here's what we know about it which isn't as much as you might think [Music] so at google i o which is google's developer conference the pixel watch was finally announced this is a real product that's coming out in the fall and for anyone who's been looking for some sort of new advanced android compatible smart watch that was made with the type of hardware focus that google's pixel line has this is it now is this going to be everything that you'd expect as kind of an apple watch killer or apple watch competitor for the android set let's see maybe not exactly the way that you think so the pixel watch was shown off and we got to see a glimpse of what it looks like it looks very apple watch like except it has a round display much like the rest of the wear os watch line the design details look even more refined this is very curved has a domed display it has a crown much like the apple watch looks like another button and it looks like it has a lot of sensors on the back those we don't really know much about yet and i'm super curious one thing that this watch has that's a big one is fitbit this is a fitbit featured watch this is something that is the first product or fruit of the collaboration between google's hardware team and fitbit which google acquired a couple of years ago last year google announced a whole revamp of its watch lineup with wear os 3 but it was kind of a half step move we got the sense that there were a lot of big changes coming and fitbit indicated that it would start moving on to wear os watches in the future last year we had the samsung galaxy watch four that was the watch that was the first to get wear os 3. but it was kind of a funky hybrid because it has wear os 3 but it also had a lot of samsung software and health features and services so it was a watch that was probably the,0.09,621.843,246.53100000000003

CNET,U4dE-OqDG-8,Watch,Google,whether some of those features become kind of fitbit features or whether fitbit services tie into other things in the google smart home we'll have to find out but i imagine that's part of the plan also for music the ability to pair with some of google's music services and have a better music system for fitbit users seems like a plus here but this is aimed to be a premium watch this is something that already has been stated to be a premium device by james park by rick osterlow who's the head of hardware google so expect a premium price and it looks like the rest of fitbit's hardware lineup for the most part will still be there or at least the trackers so that you will be able to get more affordable products so much like the pixel lineup it looks like it'll be a premium product although you know the pixel budget phone lineup does seem like it's aimed you know at a lower price so it doesn't look like that's going to be the case for the pixel watch what about premium well i did find out that you know there's a subscription plan already for fitbit fitbit premium and it looks like that's still in the works for how it works with pixel watch but we don't know exactly how but just keep in mind if you haven't used fitbit before that there is this premium service that you pay for each month that is the doorway to a lot of the insights and extra features that you'd probably want to use with fitbit fitbit's not alone in this regard most wearables now are moving to subscription models apple has fitness plus amazon halo has subscription there's fitbit and it does seem like a like a growing trend in all of this i'm not wild about subscriptions for wearables now fitbit does have some some more basic features that do work without the subscription it'll be interesting to see how all that plays out with subscription will this have all of the high-end health sensors that the other high-end fitbit products,240.48,621.843,236.56100000000004
CNET,U4dE-OqDG-8,Watch,Google,have we don't know the things that have been discussed at this point are heart rate and sleep tracking those keep showing up in what google is talking about with the pixel watch that's what james park talked about with the pixel watch so you can expect that those might be the two biggest features in what are coming as far as things like ecg as far as things like you know fitbit's more experimental features like um eda which is a electro dermal skin response for measuring potential signs of stress or temperature sensing it's not clear that any of those are necessarily showing up but if you do look at the back of the pixel watch in the photo not only do you see a variety of led markers which suggest you know the ability to check for blood oxygen or get richer heart rate but it does have that metal plate which makes me think of ecg also their eda sensor has that type of conductivity i don't want to speculate too much but it does look like a pretty advanced back as far as what you'd expect out of sensors but we just don't know so what we do know is that it'll be premium we know that it's going to have fitbit and we know it's probably going to be one of the most interesting android watches that's coming out this year but there may be more because the whole idea of wear os and is supposed to be this landscape of other compatible watches i mean fossils got wear west watches some of those are going to get warehouse 3. you've got samsung's watches and we don't know what's coming this year so there are a number of other ways that you could go and when i think about the pixel lineup i think about it as a way to introduce new cutting edge features that eventually make their way into other products will fitbit make its way into other watches it's possible but we don't really know from the past,358.56,621.843,215.99999999999997
CNET,U4dE-OqDG-8,Watch,Google,how things will shake out in the future maybe the pixel watch does become the place where fitbit lives in the wherewest landscape i guess we'll have to find out and i'm really curious what the price is although if you look at most of the watches that are out there they do tend to fall in a pretty similar territory so i wouldn't be surprised if the pixel watch landed about where the apple watch and samsung galaxy watch 4 are at and that the cellular has the bump up as you'd expect i guess we'll have to wait till the fall to find out more details the things i think about again are music about interconnectivity i also think about google fit because google fit and fitbit remain separate and it looks like that's going to still be the case now how much those really talk to each other they may not but you might find other ways that fitbit starts to be recognized by other google services and if i think about what i'd really want from this i probably want that more than you know blending google fit and fitbit because i'm not really sure i'd use google fit it was kind of a stand-in for for something better but a fitbit is able to be you know you can pull those stats and get that information or have it interact with other services and do it in a way that keeps the data still separate as google has been promising that would be really interesting uh and and that's pretty much what i'm looking for i mean the smartwatch landscape is pretty straightforward at this point but i think what fitbit brings to the table as far as insights as far as some of the more advanced sensor features and some of the more advanced research that they've been doing it really makes it an interesting product challenging apple challenging samsung for where health tech is going to be heading on our wrist that's what we know so far let me know if you have any thoughts down below and those are our initial thoughts based on google's pixel watch which is real and coming pretty soon thanks for watching [Music],466.8,621.843,244.25800000000004
CNET,vifbj_PwqW4,Watch,Google,google i o is coming up let's talk about what to expect google's big developers conference runs from may 11th through the 12th the company put out a schedule recently on day one we'll get a keynote and we'll see what's new in android 13 augmented reality chrome os google home and google pay day two is a bit nerdier with sessions on how to build apps for wear os deploying custom machine learning models to mobile designing apps for large screens and how to add voice assistant to apps so that's the official lineup but it's a little vague right let's dig through some reports to get a better idea of what we could see [Music] we'll start with the pixel watch which could show up at i o this is the part of the video where i say the following is unofficial google has not confirmed the existence of the pixel watch well other than a trademark application but we'll get to that later way back in april 2021 john prosser over at front page tech had renders of what he said was the pixel watch with the code name rohan here's what it looked like a black round watch processor said that the renders were based on images he received back then he had heard that the pixel watch could come out in october of 2021 or it could be pushed fast forward to april 2022 and evan blast published a post entitled this is rohan google's pixel watch evan blass is one of the most reliable sources when it comes to leaks so take that for what it's worth the image is a render of a simple looking watch it's round it features the date the time steps a fitbit logo and heart rate on the face of the watch to the right is what looks like a rotating crown the device would be running where os 3.1 the image looks a lot like the video published by front page tech if you want more proof on an upcoming google pixel watch google redesigned its,0.0,621.843,217.59999999999997

CNET,vifbj_PwqW4,Watch,Google,developer's conference so talking about software is usually the focus also google regularly holds an october event for its phones so it could show the watch then since it would be an accessory for the pixel like the pixel buds that being said maybe google would want to show off its own watch so developers are motivated to make or update apps for wear os there are also developer sessions for wear os on day two so i'm 50 50 on this let me know what you think about a potential pixel watch at i o and if you're interested what else will we see at i o i'm glad i asked me we should be also seeing more key features of android 13. we saw a developer's preview in march this part's official so that's good that preview featured improvements so it would be easier for android devices to connect to nearby devices without needing location permissions that would mean your phone could find devices easier while keeping your data more secure the developer's preview also showed off the option to theme app icons in supported android launchers it's basically the material you designed from android 12 turned up a little bit material u let you customize the colors of android based on your wallpaper there is also a quick settings api that would make it easier for apps to add shortcuts to your quick settings area that's the thing you see when you swipe down from the top of an android phone the beta is out now and added more granular permissions for media file access in the past if an app wanted access to your music files it would actually gain access to all of your files with this new feature the app can ask for specific types of files there's also a new anticipatory audio routing feature here's how google describes it the new api allows you to retrieve a list of devices that may be used to play,317.6,621.843,190.39900000000006

CNET,mhffR-IrvME,Watch,Samsung,the Galaxy watch 6 is the perfect example of what's old is New Again the bezel is back on the six classic and the regular Galaxy watch 6 looks and feels pretty much the same as last year's model I've been testing both the six and the six classic and they share the same internal specs with the main differences being build material that rotating bezel and of course the price bezel enthusiasts brace yourself because they're satisfying is one hundred dollars more now the watches come in a small and a large size I'm wearing the small version of both that's the 40 millimeter on the six and the 43 millimeter on the classic and my wrist measures 152 millimeters all the sensors are the same as the Galaxy watch 5. heart rate body composition and skin temperature they both have LTE versions so you can use the watch and stay connected when you're away from your phone so what's different software bigger screens and a slightly longer lasting battery but not by much Samsung's upgraded the AMOLED displays to a higher resolution than last year and they're also physically bigger too absolutely no complaints there but it is the maximum screen brightness that's really been the most helpful for me and it hits a maximum 2000 nits that's twice as bright as the watch 5 and watch 5 Pro now this means you can see the display,1.82,621.843,154.05899999999997
CNET,mhffR-IrvME,Watch,Samsung,much more easily in the sunlight and the always-on display is also brighter that is super helpful for me during outdoor workouts which was one of my complaints about last year's watches because I just couldn't see that display well enough when I was out on a run but that bigger and brighter screen naturally brings up the battery life question Samsung quotes the same runtime for both watch sizes actually so up to 30 hours with the always on active and 40 hours with it off did I meet those numbers in my testing I got a maximum of 27 hours with the always on display active now that's with notifications sleep tracking and a 30 minute GPS workout without LTE if I had a bit of a heavier days use that's more like 24 hours slightly better than the watch5 but really not by that much and it takes just over an hour to charge from Flat to full using the charger or you can of course use reverse wireless charging which is always a bonus with the Galaxy watch if you want the longest lasting battery that's still the Galaxy watch 5 Pro Samsung is keeping that in the lineup and that lasts two and a half to three days with similar use okay it's finally time to talk about that bezel and I'm happy to have it back because it makes navigation so much more fun and practical especially if you're wearing gloves or you have sweaty or wet fingers it is slimmer than the Galaxy,79.14,621.843,151.381
CNET,mhffR-IrvME,Watch,Samsung,watch 4 classic bezel and it generally looks more Sleek overall but it doesn't do anything new it's not exciting it should really never have left the Galaxy watch series the regular watch 6 has a touch bezel around the edge of the screen so you can move your finger around to get the same effect as the physical bezel but one unexpected big perk for me is this new watch band design it's a one-click button so you can swap bands in and out really easily and it is retrofitted so you can still use those older spring pin bands and the new bands are also backwards compatible with older watches I also appreciate that the watch bands sit a little bit more flush with the body and it's generally a very comfortable watch to wear especially this hybrid leather band on the classic these are the first watches to run wear os4 but at the time of recording two of the flagship apps with this update aren't available yet Gmail and calendar WhatsApp is there though and the watch is also running one UI 5 watch on top of Ware os4 such a mouthful and that has a couple of Galaxy watch exclusive features including extra sleet coaching features and emergency SOS to send your location when it detects a fall now you also don't need to reset your watch when you switch to a new phone which is kind of a big deal especially if you upgrade,154.68,621.843,142.50000000000003
CNET,mhffR-IrvME,Watch,Samsung,a lot and Samsung wallet replaces Samsung pay so you can add digital keys and membership cards to the watch if you have a flip or a fold five you can control the camera in Flex mode but you don't need to feel left out if you have an older Galaxy phone this is the s22 ultra and I still get camera controls including zooming with the bezel which is kind of nice and Universal gestures is one of those hidden features I really think needs more air time just like Assistive touch on the Apple watch you can control the Galaxy watch with gestures if you can't touch the screen or press buttons like I alluded to earlier there really isn't much new when it comes to the health and fitness side on the Galaxy watch 6 only a new track run workout type and you can now create custom workouts it's still Auto detects activities like running swimming walking and Samsung quietly added back in cycling yay the personalized heart rate zones for running is part of one ui5 watch so that means it's also coming to older Galaxy watches from the four and five but this is something that Apple Fitbit and Garmin have had for a while now so it's really just plain catch up the new sleep tracking features are just bringing the watch up to speed with the others on the market really the biggest change that I noticed was displaying,226.14,621.843,137.52
CNET,mhffR-IrvME,Watch,Samsung,your sleep score on the watch yes you do need to charge this watch every day to track sleep but fortunately if you are running low at the end of the day an eight minute charge should give you enough juice to get through the nights the Galaxy watch 6 now supports irregular heart rhythm notifications but you will need a Galaxy phone to use this feature and to use the ECG now you can get the Samsung health monitor app on other Androids by installing an APK but technique it's not supported and if you want more analysis on sensor accuracy I've got all of those details in my text review Linked In the description suffice to say because the sensors are all the same as the watch5 really isn't that much new to say so buy it skip it or try it I would say try it if you're upgrading from an older Galaxy watch before the series 4 that happens to run tizen if you have a Galaxy watch 4 or 5 look it doesn't really make that much sense to upgrade unless you get an amazing trading deal and you do want a little bit more battery life and a slightly bigger screen because don't forget you're getting the main software updates anyway once once ui5 watch arrives later in the year thanks so much for watching I hope this review was helpful for you as always I love to answer any questions that I didn't get to in this review down in the comments so let me know what else you want to know and I'll catch you next time,294.78,621.843,140.92000000000002

CNET,1qkFQuDjyVA,Watch,Samsung,[Music] the galaxy watch 5 pro strikes a good middle ground between true smartwatch and sports watch it's got a big battery turn-by-turn navigation and a super tough construction that means you can use it pretty much anywhere but it only comes in one 45 millimeter size which does restrict the appeal to people who are okay with wearing a pretty large smart watch samsung has two galaxy watch fives the pro edition which is this one and the regular galaxy watch 5. now they actually share pretty much all of the same sensors most of the same functionality and the same interface so i have fully reviewed the galaxy watch 5. you can check out that review right here or linked in the description because i'm really going to focus and concentrate on what makes this galaxy watch 5 pro different in terms of all of the construction sports features and things like sensor accuracy so does the galaxy watch 5 pro really deserve its pro name let's find out first things first we have to talk about what this watch doesn't have on the outside and that is the physical rotating bezel the stalwart of all galaxy watches pretty much since the original galaxy watch back in 2018. i can see why samsung removed the physical rotating bezel from this edition at least because if you're doing something super active you're outdoors you don't necessarily want this to get jammed up with dirt or sand or anything like that but i miss it and it's really not as easy to navigate this watch especially if say your hands are sweaty or they're wet to make up for it there is a software-based touch bezel the same one that's on the galaxy watch five i think it does work a little bit better on the galaxy watch five pro only because there is that raised edge around the screen so you can actually move your finger around and kind of keep it within the bounds of the display because your fingers resting against the rim rather than kind of sliding around anywhere without the edge on the regular galaxy watch 5. we also have to talk about the size and the bulk of this watch now i am used to wearing pretty big sports watches say like the garmin fx2 that's 47 millimeters you can even get bigger ones with the garmin fenix series for example for people that have smaller wrists than mine i can really see this being a little bit too bulky and especially if you're wearing something like a tight sleeve top or you know you have a hiking jacket with you know cuffs and things like that trying,0.19,621.843,307.4110000000002
CNET,1qkFQuDjyVA,Watch,Samsung,to get it over that might be a little bit of a difficult issue so to give you a visual here it is on my wrist and here it is on a man's wrist to give you an idea of what it might look like on you speaking of durability this watch is rated ip68 so it's dust and water resistant it also has a much more scratch resistant screen than the regular galaxy watch 5 with its sapphire glass as well as a titanium construction now i haven't been gentle with this watch i have dropped it by accident several times when i've been putting it on the charger just because i kind of can't get the balance right when i have the strap kind of still buckled in i have also taken it to the beach and got sand and stuff on it and i have definitely knocked it against concrete accidentally because i'm clumsy when i walk through door frames what can i say and it still looks brand new of course the real test is going to be long term durability and on something like a construction site so i do have some more durability testing to do so stay tuned now speaking of that watch band it is a new magnetic d sports band it's really quite durable and comfortable to wear i really like the design of it it takes a little bit of extra fiddling to make sure that it's exactly the right size to your wrist but once you've got it locked in it's great really really seamless and stays on really well especially when you're doing something super active like during a workout for example the screen itself super bright responsive sharp it's pretty much the same functionality as you find on the regular galaxy watch 5. one thing that i really did notice about this display when i was using it in always-on mode specifically during a workout outdoors was kind of how dim it was and how difficult it was to see especially when it was super bright outside i'd either have to shade the screen stop my workout to make sure i could see my metrics clearly or alternatively you know raise to wake and make sure the screen would come on at full brightness i'm hoping that a future software update could potentially address this because i have noticed the always on display is kind of almost too bright indoors when there's like not much ambient light but it's too dim when you're outside and there's way too much ambient light so i think a little bit of extra calibration would be nice fingers crossed that that's possible in an upcoming update please this watch has a couple of exclusive,153.12,621.843,282.31899999999996
CNET,1qkFQuDjyVA,Watch,Samsung,tracking features and sports features that you won't find on the regular galaxy watch five the first is track back now this works in only two activity types at the moment hiking and outdoor cycling so to turn this on you need to go over to the settings cog turn on track back and what it's going to do is route you back exactly the same way that you came in it's going to give you turn by turn navigation and it's also going to give you some vibrations and audio cues on your wrist if you want that the second exclusive feature is turn by turn navigation again only works with hiking and cycling activity types at the moment to turn this on you'll need to go to that specific workout find settings and then tap target to turn it on and then tap it into it again and scroll down to find the route option you'll then be prompted to open it up on the phone and choose the route that you want to use turn by turn navigation on it will port it to the watch and then you can also get voice and map guidance quite similar to how it works with the track back feature really nice easy to use for beginners except it's kind of a little bit buried in those menus so you have to use those steps to find it and the third exclusive option is more generally using gpx files to either import or export route information to your watch all you have to do is go into the samsung health app i found it really simple to export a quick route that i did from strava as a gpx file and then put it straight onto the watch within about five seconds it had synced over and i was ready to do one of my favorite bike ride routes let's touch on some of the other health and fitness features on this watch the first is automatic workout detection really reliable on the galaxy watch 5 series it would always kick in after about 10 minutes of me doing an outdoor workout say like a walk or a run this watch also has high and low heart rate alerts and heart rate sensor accuracy overall is really important to talk about i always compare against a chest strap and the galaxy watch 5 pro really surprised me with how well it kept up with the chest strap for this almost two hour outdoor bike ride as you can see from this chart it sticks really really close to that chest strap it's almost feet for beat just as well because you cannot pair an external heart rate monitor via bluetooth with the galaxy watch 5 pro at least not yet this watch also has an ecg or electrocardiogram app this is one of the features you will,294.16,621.843,303.2
CNET,1qkFQuDjyVA,Watch,Samsung,need a samsung phone to use though because it requires a samsung health monitor app and that's not available on the play store you can also turn on fall detection on this watch and you can also have it active during workouts if you want so if you take a hard fall and you don't respond then the watch will alert your emergency contacts the one other mysterious sensor that's on the galaxy watch 5 series is skin temperature with an infrared sensor on the underside of the watch unfortunately at the time of recording this video that sensor wasn't active yet so i can't really tell you much more about how it works but hopefully by the time you watch this video maybe it will be released and available and i will update my full text review which is linked in the description with lots more detail so what's missing from the health and fitness features on the galaxy watch 5 pro compared to some other sports and fitness watches out there well for me the big one is recovery metrics i would love to see some sort of indication on this watch of recovery time needed after i finish a workout or even just an overall kind of score gives me an idea of how my body is coping with how i'm training other watchers do this like garmin's body battery for example and fitbit's daily readiness score takes into account things like your overall sleep activity levels and heart rate variability to give you an idea of how well you're coping and if you should push yourself to do that workout or not [Music] maybe you don't care that much about the health and fitness features on the galaxy watch 5 but you're really looking at it because it has a larger capacity battery than the regular galaxy watch 5 series and yes i can verify and you know do a little bit of a dance in my seat because it does last longer and it meets the claims in some respects first up samsung claims 80 hours of regular use from this watch i couldn't quite get there but there's a couple of reasons why and i think if you have really light usage patterns you could meet that target so i was able to get between 58 and 60 hours of continuous use from this watch before i needed to charge that took into account having the always on display active doing a one-hour gps workout every day also doing sleep tracking overnight tracking things like continuous heart rate and blood oxygen plus getting notifications from my phone for gps use only the claim is 20 hours and while i could not achieve a 20 hour continuous hike for,447.039,621.843,308.00100000000003
CNET,1qkFQuDjyVA,Watch,Samsung,you as much as i would try more power to you if you can i did do a bit of a battery drain test so i started at a hundred percent i made sure the watch was in airplane mode i went on my two hour hike and uh two hours in the battery had only dropped 10 and it was sitting at 90 so with those exact usage patterns i can definitely see it would get to 20 hours of gps use which was nice like the regular galaxy watch 5 this also has some fast charging features on board you can put it on a charger from flat to 45 within about 30 minutes and overall it takes for me at least a little over two hours to reach a full charge the one is you will need to use a 25 watt charger to achieve these fast charging speeds which is not included in the box because of course it's not [Music] so can the galaxy watch 5 pro go head to head with other dedicated sports watchers well for serious athletes probably not just yet only because this watch doesn't have certain things that you might need such as recovery metrics as well as more in-depth navigation that goes beyond what we talked about in terms of the trackback features and turn-by-turn navigation that works with other activities that aren't necessarily hiking and cycling and also don't forget that the battery while it is really good compared to the regular galaxy watch five it's not going to be enough if you're taking this out for multi-day activities outdoors especially compared to when other fitness watches can last a week or more under the same conditions all that said for most people the galaxy watch 5 pro is going to be a great option if you want the best of all worlds you want some sports tracking options you also want an lte version so you can stay connected when you are out on the go you also have the smarts of everything that wear os has to offer including all of the google app flexibility third-party apps and near seamless connection with your phone because that's something that many other serious sports watchers don't have thanks so much for watching if you have extra questions about the galaxy watch 5 pro i have a full written review which is linked in the description it's got pretty much everything you need to know about that watch any extra questions you have you can hit me up either in the comments or on your favorite social media platform until next time i'll see you later [Music],600.88,621.843,310.1599999999999
CNET,kIDwPUXSeRQ,Watch,Samsung,the galaxy watch 5 has a lot going for it a gorgeous screen new temperature sensor a better fit on the wrist than before and a bigger battery but even though this is still the best android smartwatch you can get right now i'm still left wanting more this year there are two additions a 40 and 44 millimeter regular galaxy watch 5 and a larger 45 millimeter galaxy watch pro this review is concentrating just on the galaxy watch 5 but i have also reviewed the galaxy watch 5 pro to see that in depth review you can click right up here or in the description when samsung came out with its new generation of wear os watches in 2021 they were the first cab off the rank fast forward a year later with the pixel watch on the horizon and a whole suite of new wear os watches coming really soon there is a lot more competition for your money speaking of prices you can find that linked in the description below but let's get into the review of the galaxy watch five this watch looks pretty much the same on the outside as last year's galaxy watch four apart from losing the fan favorite physical rotating bezel on the galaxy watchful classic i am not gonna lie i do miss having a physical rotating bezel to navigate through menus and even just use as a fidget spinner whenever i'm just sitting around and a little bit bored there is a touch sensitive bezel that is active on the galaxy watch 5. it's the same as what we saw on the galaxy watch 4. it does give you a little bit of haptic feedback that kind of clicks almost simulates the feel of a real moving bezel when you do move your finger around the edge it's precise enough if you go slow enough but i would much rather samsung have given us a little bit more physical real estate on that screen maybe an edge-to-edge display if possible rather than having a touch bezel at all i find myself mostly using the touch screen and the buttons the good news is if you're coming from last year's galaxy watch 4 you can actually use the same straps on the galaxy watch 5 i was able to interchange and swap out the straps from my galaxy watchful classic onto the watch 5. the watch 5 has tougher sapphire crystal glass than last year's model i've been wearing the watch for about two weeks and in that time you know i haven't exactly been gentle with it but i haven't tried to destroy it either i don't have any visible scratches or anything like that on the glass or the,0.16,621.843,298.402
CNET,kIDwPUXSeRQ,Watch,Samsung,casing itself but of course if that changes i will update my full text review which is linked in the description all of this year's galaxy watch 5 models are ip68 rated that means that they are dust and water resistant so they'll definitely be able to track things like your swims and you know if you need to take it to the shower i guess you can just try not to get any soap with it because that's probably not included under warranty i really find that the redesigned back panel on the galaxy watch 5 helps it to sit much more snug against my wrist especially compared to last year's versions and i definitely find it does help a lot with sensor accuracy particularly around the heart rate sensor and we will get into that just in a little bit okay let's talk software now this is the second generation galaxy watch that's running the newer os platform that's co-designed between samsung and google but really it doesn't feel all that different at all from last year's models it's still running the same one ui interface over the top so it really feels much more like a samsung watch than it does overall as a google watch that said all of the google apps that you'd expect are on board and work really seamlessly you can of course use google maps you can also navigate using the watch there's things like youtube music and most importantly it now comes at launch unlike the galaxy watch for it comes with the google assistant so you can install that right on your watch first thing i did replace bixby with the google assistant i think that was a very good call performance overall is really snappy it's using the same processor as last year as well which is kind of disappointing given that there's a new qualcomm processor out there potentially that this could have used but maybe it just wasn't ready in time to integrate it in the watch but that being said things like the speaker and microphone on board work really really well and this was with the bluetooth and gps version with my phone within range of course if you get the lte or cellular version that costs a little bit extra you can take calls on the go unfortunately i did not get to test that version but stay tuned i will update the full text review if i can get my hands on one a lot of people ask me this question in my preview of the galaxy watches can you play music from the onboard,150.64,621.843,277.6809999999999
CNET,kIDwPUXSeRQ,Watch,Samsung,speaker without bluetooth headphones attached yes i am so happy to report you actually can either with the stock music app when you have music stored on your phone you can also use a third-party app say like spotify if you have a premium subscription and listen to songs without headphones uh look most people probably don't use this feature but i love it you also get some new watch faces on the galaxy watch 5. i like them they're really pretty they also have some extra ones with additional complications so you can customize it with lots of different widgets everywhere the good news is again if you have a galaxy watch for you are going to get these watch faces in a future update so that's really good news some of the input methods include a full size qwerty keyboard this actually works really well i was able to swipe and send messages without too many errors at all i would say if you have slightly larger fingers might be a little trickier on the 40 millimeter watch definitely a larger screen size would help with that i actually found that speech to text was actually really quite accurate in getting my australian accent right and didn't give me anywhere near the amount of errors i was getting with previous generations so i really appreciated that overall though the user experience is very similar to last year's galaxy watch 4 and i know i keep saying this and i'm so sorry i sound like a broker on record but it really shows you just how much of an iterative update things have been so far at least in terms of workouts and heart rate sensor accuracy and all of those other health and fitness features on board the galaxy watch 5 does have quite a bit it does of course track over 90 different workout types it can also auto detect a range of different workouts including things like outdoor walks runs and elliptical workouts this was really reliable for me in terms of kicking in after 10 minutes of doing say an outdoor walk it would pop up when i forgot to start the activity and say would you like to track this walk and it would give me credit for that previous 10 minutes that i'd already done i definitely find the heart rate sensor on the galaxy watch 5 is more accurate than the galaxy watch 4 and to verify this claim i did test against a chest strap i did a couple of different workouts but really for a steady state cardio workout say like a walk or a,291.12,621.843,296.4769999999999
CNET,kIDwPUXSeRQ,Watch,Samsung,light jog the watch actually did a really good job of keeping close to the strap there's also a bio impedance sensor on board this is able to track your body composition so talking about things like overall fat levels as well as muscle composition now i'm not really a heavy user of this feature at all so it's pretty much the same as what we saw last year on the galaxy watch 4. however i can see it being pretty useful for somebody if you're trying to say lose weight or build muscle you can also set targets over time which might be really nice if you're working towards a particular goal there's also an ecg or electrocardiogram app it is fda cleared and it does help detect signs of atrial fibrillation it is an on-demand sensor though it's not doing any background checks or readings say for irregular heart rhythm like something like the apple watch or the fitbit does so do keep that in mind the other thing to note is that this is one of the features that you will need to pair the galaxy watch 5 with a samsung phone to actually be able to use i did pair this watch with a pixel and alas you cannot access the samsung health monitor app and you need that to access the ecg and we've got to talk about that skin temperature sensor because that's the big new feature on the galaxy watch 5. i wish i could tell you more about it but at the time of recording it is not active now this is located on the underside of the watch we can see exactly where it is samsung has said that this will be used during sleep tracking potentially to help detect signs of fever maybe even to help track menstrual cycles again i will keep you updated in the full text review when this actually gets updated and maybe by the time you watch this it will be updated as well so i hope it's going to come sooner rather than later [Music] all right it's the part you've been waiting for i know it's the part that gets me excited about smartwatch reviews i mean not really but it's really important to talk about battery life because if you've got to keep charging your watch all the time that's pretty annoying now what i can say is that the galaxy watch 5 does have a larger capacity battery than last year's models does it make a huge difference in practice not really and i'm kind of disappointed to say that i really tried to push this watch to reach the samsung claims of,442.16,621.843,303.921
CNET,kIDwPUXSeRQ,Watch,Samsung,total battery life it could potentially achieve i really struggled to get there so samsung claims that this particular model the 14 millimeter galaxy watch 5 can reach up to 40 hours of use however i don't know how i would possibly get there without turning off all of the essential features that i would want a smartwatch for using airplane mode most of the time and just using my watch to tell the time again kind of defeats the purpose of a smartwatch now my regular usage includes things like getting a few notifications from my phone throughout the day i also use a few apps sparingly and the google assistant maybe once or twice and do a 30 minute one hour gps workout i also try and track sleep with the always on display turned off i'm able to get 24 hours between charges on the galaxy watch five so better than the watch four at least the watch for 40 millimeter that i was using it's still not as good as it could be if i turn the always on display on that number reduces to around 21 hours so if i do want to track sleep overnight i do need to put the watch on its charger just to give it a little bit more juice before the morning fortunately you can do some quick charging on the galaxy watch 5. you can go from flat to 45 in 30 minutes that's the claim i also tested it out with a timer i was able to pretty much get that number on the money however you do need to also budget in a 25 watt adapter a usbc adapter to reach those numbers and guess what doesn't come in the box i guess just the same as the apple watch when you know that fast charger doesn't come in the box either it's good that it's there but it is an extra investment especially if you don't already have a 25 watt charger or more for your android phone so in sum the galaxy watch 5 really does have a lot of great features it is definitely the best android watch for now but there is a lot more upcoming competition that really could give this a run for its money and if you do have last year's galaxy watch 4 there's not a huge reason to upgrade unless you want something like the larger galaxy watch 5 pro that has some additional sports features a more durable construction and of course a slightly larger battery thank you so much for watching again if you have any additional questions about the galaxy watch 5 hopefully i've answered those for you in my full text review that's linked in the description and make sure you check out the full review of the galaxy watch 5 pro see ya [Music],594.16,621.843,315.21799999999996
CNET,QK6ZEoeNnsQ,Watch,Samsung,the galaxy watch 5 series has landed and we have a lot to talk about we're going to walk through a lot of the main new features including things like new watch faces as well as the sensors that are on board do a bit of a workout with the galaxy watch 5 pro and some of those new sports modes that it has and most importantly perhaps somewhat superficially let's talk about how it feels on the wrist and do we really miss that physical rotating bezel well we're going to find out now stay tuned for the full review which will be coming really soon obviously with two days use i can't do a full deep dive for you because there's a lot more data analysis and things like that to get into so make sure to subscribe if you're not already until then this is my first 48 hours with the galaxy watch 5 and watch 5 pro okay let's start things off with the regular galaxy watch 5 first this is the 40 millimeter edition so it's the smaller of the two sizes available i do have a fairly small wrist and it does sit quite snugly against the back of my wrist like you can see here there's no gaps or anything like that and i do think that that redesigned back panel that is on the watch 5 series does go a long way to help keep it more snug on my wrist compared to say the galaxy watch 4 classic that i've also been wearing in the same size which just doesn't sit as securely against the wrist all right let's look at some of the watch faces because i don't know about you but i like a couple new watch faces just quickly there are a few new ones that i found on the watch 5 so far including garden which is this one here and then we have gradient number this one kind of looks a little bit similar to that big blob one that you might remember from the watch for big blob is not the technical correct name but i'm going with it the big change is,0.08,621.843,229.60200000000003
CNET,QK6ZEoeNnsQ,Watch,Samsung,that you can add complications to the side of this one now we have to talk about the lack of physical bezel which i'm not gonna lie i'm still kind of sad about but the touch bezel i feel has potentially improved a little bit over when i've last used it on the non-classic galaxy watch 4 series but if i go slow enough i do feel like it gives me a similar experience to the physical rotating bezel but yeah i still miss it the rest of the interface looks pretty much exactly the same as it did on the watch 4 especially if you have the latest one ui update so no big changes there the sensors haven't really changed too much either the blood oxygen sensor is still there you get the heart rate sensor with high and low heart rate alerts the ecg or electrocardiogram app as well as the bio impedance sensor to give you an analysis of body composition the one sensor that i can't show you yet is the skin temperature sensor on the galaxy watch 5 series because it's not active yet at the time of recording but hopefully soon but i can show you this sensor on the back that's the infrared sensor it's taking skin temperature and probably more often than not it's going to be used during sleep the watch 5 also will have some improvements to sleep tracking i've been wearing it to sleep and as you can see even though i've got some good time of sleep the actual quality probably wasn't so great 67 as a sleep score is pretty low that's because i was awake you know probably thinking about what i was gonna say in this video anyway you get your sleep stages all listed here which is not anything really new if you've seen a lot of other wearables that do the sleep stages and more importantly if you wear this for seven nights in a row you'll get a sleep animal that represents how you sleep and a sleep pattern then it's also going to give you,116.56,621.843,216.39899999999994
CNET,QK6ZEoeNnsQ,Watch,Samsung,a guide on how to improve your sleep over five weeks obviously haven't had it for seven day nights yet but stay tuned i will let you know how useful that sleep guide actually is being aware os watch of course google apps yay and the google assistant more importantly now just be aware it does come with your old mate bixby as the default i went in straight away and changed it other google apps include the ability to have youtube music and google maps here as you can see too which is nice and some quick battery impressions so far over the past 48 hours the smaller 40 millimeter version seems to be on track to give me around 24 hours of total battery life from a single charge maybe i can eke out a little bit more from it because i did a really long one and a half to two hour workout yesterday which you will see shortly with the galaxy watch five pro but it was probably a little longer than kind of like a normal day so that might have impacted battery life more testing needs to be done stay tuned and i'll let you know oh and that was with the always on display off so i'm sure with always on it might drop a little further all right galaxy watch five pro time this one obviously much larger than the galaxy watch five that i've been wearing this is 45 millimeters it's only one size and even though i have a really small wrist or i wouldn't say really small but it is you know a fairly small wrist i do feel like it does sit fairly securely on my wrist definitely thicker than the watch 5 regular version but that's because it's got a bigger battery and a more durable,224.799,621.843,218.31999999999996
CNET,QK6ZEoeNnsQ,Watch,Samsung,construction as well the watch strap also works in a different way to the watch five it has a magnetic clasp this is the pro analog watch face yes you can also get this on the regular galaxy watch five so don't be too alarmed if you really like it but you think this is gonna be too big for you it actually also has this option where you can change it to actually have the compass which is kind of nice the touch bezel on this one i feel actually works better not just because it's you know functionally better or anything like that but really because you have that raised lip of the actual physical bezel on the watch to stop your finger from kind of rocking and rolling outside of the boundary which really helps me at least the sensor's overall functionality and the interface pretty much the same as the regular galaxy watch 5 but there is something new in terms of the software roll tape the watch 5 pro has a couple of extra sports features that the regular watch 5 does not have including track back this is the first day of wearing the watch 5 pro i am on a hike with my dog in the middle of golden gate park in san francisco so i'm going to test it out and see if it can navigate me back to my starting point it's really easy to activate you just go into the settings while you are currently doing any particular workout and then find the track back feature and it should navigate you back to your start point so let's see if you can get me back home [Music] so the green line is showing the route on the way back and the blue line is the route on the way in just kind of neat make sure i'm actually going the right way no i think i should just rely on my dog rather than the watch because she seems to know the way to get out,333.919,621.843,208.661
CNET,QK6ZEoeNnsQ,Watch,Samsung,but the watch is telling me i need to turn pretty soon anyway and this is exactly the route that i came back in on ah made it out to at least the traffic lights which is a good sign oh this is good it says my next turn's coming up so it buzzed and gave me a little notification i just pulled out the phone too late to capture it but you get the idea [Music] and we're back they worked one other sports feature that is new is the ability to import route information from a gpx file and then get things like turn by turn navigation it'll ask me to pull up my phone and then bring up this page that says about routes and then import a gpx file here's one i prepared earlier that was a nice long bike ride and make sure that it's chosen as cycling or hiking okay there it is on the watch itself and now we can just start the route and it's going to give me turn by turn navigation and show me the map as we go again like the watch five still lots of battery testing to do on this one but to give you an idea of battery drain that walk and the hike that you just saw that took one and a half hours the battery dropped about 15 so the claim is to have 20 hours of gps usage so we'll see we'll see if we can get there i don't know if i'm up for a 20 hour hike but let me know i'll see what i can do those are some early first impressions of the new galaxy watch 5 series if you had a question that i didn't answer in this video do leave me a comment and let me know i'm going to be answering as many of them as i can over the coming days as well as addressing some of them in the full review which is coming soon obviously lots more testing to be done in the meantime thanks again for watching and i'll catch you next time [Music],442.0,621.843,226.3400000000001

Marques Brownlee,hOi8s2wkX4A,VR,Apple,"(lively music) - Is this another Vision Pro video? - Uh, yes. Yeah. Just, it's a good one though. I promise. - Yeah, mhm. I'm sure. - No. Okay. So I've been thinking a lot about what a second-generation Vision Pro might look like. - But didn't this literally just came out? - No, I know, but okay, so obviously, there are lots of other VR headsets, but there are lots of things that got way more interesting about this one joining the market, and if you compare this to those, this is missing stuff. - Right, but that is also the most expensive ones. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. There are things that the Quest 3 does that if the Vision Pro did it, it would feel like it's a revolutionary change to this thing. It's a good video, I swear. - All right. I'll allow it. - This doesn't work though. You can't. - Okay. Fine. - Anyway. (upbeat music) (logo whooshes) So I don't think the Vision Pro is gonna be an every single year product update, like the iPhone. I think it's gonna be one of those that's like every couple of years. You stack up enough tech updates every once in a while and it's worthy of a new generation and then it's a bigger deal when it comes out, and by the way, that's how a lot of other VR headsets have been. The Quest 3 came out like three years after the Quest 2, and the PS VR 2 came out like six years after the first one. So, in a sense, this is already very early thoughts, but it's been out for a little bit and we're really starting to get a sense of where people are using it and how people are getting the most value out of it, and let me tell you, a lot of people are definitely still not convinced on the whole VR or Vision Pro thing at all. Like, it's an interesting product for sure, but it just doesn't do much, and I started having those thoughts immediately as soon as I started testing this thing, just all sorts of missing stuff that I would like it to do. So this is all those things in one place. So probably the biggest thing that you've noticed if you've been familiar with the VR headset world or used any other VR headset before is the Vision Pro is missing shared experiences. Like, you are always so alone in this headset. Like, meaning there are lots of other great, super immersive experiences, and you can be productive and you can watch a movie, but no matter what's happening, you're always alone. Even if you have pass through on, nobody else can see what you see, and so it's basically impossible to share what you're experiencing without, you know, mirroring everything on an iPad or something like that. Now, FaceTime is close. It's one thing, but I'm talking about",0.0,621.843,151.88000000000008
Marques Brownlee,hOi8s2wkX4A,VR,Apple,"sharing one virtual space with more than one person or seeing the same virtual environment at the same time with multiple people or seeing the same virtual object from two different perspectives at the same time. You ever play ""Rec Room""? It's one of the oldest but most fun games on the Meta Quest. It's just so simple. You're just out there having fun, but it's a bunch of people running around a room or an environment to different game areas where they can jump into an experience and play a game together. So, in that digital space, you look around and see other people, and I use people with air quotes, but you see them, they see you, and you can see the same environment from different angles at the same time and explore it together. It doesn't even have to be super realistic or high resolution or convince you that it's another reality, but it's just way more social and interactive and fun that way, but on Apple Vision Pro, aside from FaceTime really, all of the other experiences, it's just you in there solo. Like, there's nobody else in there. So, no matter what you're doing, no matter how immersive the movie is or no matter how good the game is around you, you're in there by yourself and nobody else can see what you're seeing. Like, just, here's a basic example. How sick would it be if you and the person next to you on a plane could sync up your experiences and both watch the same movie in a virtual theater at the same time? Simple as that, or maybe if you were manipulating a 3D object in space, wouldn't it make a ton of sense for someone else to be able to share that object with you so that they can see how you're manipulating it? Like, it feels like it just makes too much sense. I told you guys about that Sky Guide app, which has like, you know, you look up and there's all the stars and the constellations and it shows you where they're all supposed to be. It is pretty awesome. Funny enough, there's a laser pointer feature that lets you point a laser pointer at the sky and circle around and point at things and draw things, but, still, nobody can see what you're pointing at with the laser, even if they have a Vision Pro. So there are two basic types of shared experiences that it would just be great for Apple to add to this thing. The first one is two different people with Vision Pros are in the same room with pass through on and one of them drops a virtual object into that room and the other can see it at the same time. Manipulate the object. They can see it as well. Great. The other is two different people with Vision Pros in different places, halfway across the world, doesn't matter. They both turn on or join the same virtual environment and can see it at the same time. As of right now, I believe the first one is harder because the way these headsets work with the pass through",154.02,621.843,168.72
Marques Brownlee,hOi8s2wkX4A,VR,Apple,"is, basically, in real time, they are mapping the volume of space around you with the sensors on the front of it, the surfaces, the walls, the floor, the objects around you and everything. That's how Vision OS is able to lock your apps floating in 3D space and how it's casting shadows onto different surfaces in your room with decent accuracy, but there's no guarantee that, if you're in a room with someone else who also has a headset on, that both your headsets are mapping the room in the exact same way. Like, maybe I place an object into space, but your headset doesn't see space there so it's confused, or it doesn't map my hands or what I'm manipulating in the exact same way. It's just not exactly guaranteed to be the same, but the other kind, just sharing a virtual environment someone builds with anyone anywhere in the world seems like a no-brainer. Like, being able to watch a movie in a virtual movie theater with someone else who also gets a seat in that movie theater, playing an obvious multiplayer game in the same environment. Like, this stuff is pretty basic with VR. I love multiplayer table tennis in the Quest. It's one of my favorite shared VR experiences. You can play against people anywhere else in the world. There's all kinds of other multiplayer games like this in VR. That is a huge part of the VR gaming experience, and I just wonder why this doesn't have that yet. It seems like a huge, huge thing, especially, and I know, you know, Apple has environments that they've built in and they're massive in high resolution, but you can only move a little bit before you're out of the play zone, if you will. It's fascinating. I wonder if that's something to do with the way Apple thinks about these environments. Nevertheless, what I know is that's the number one missing feature on the Vision Pro that I'd love to see in a second gen. Now, the other big one that stands out to me is, if I wanna use Vision Pro a lot in, let's say, multiple, just two different locations, home and work, I wish that it had a memory of all the windows and apps that I leave open in each place. See, Vision Pro is actually already amazing at this in one space. It's seriously incredible. Windows stay locked to where you leave them as it live maps its way around your space. So you can pin something to a wall and then walk around and pin something to another wall or just in the middle of the room. Leave the room, come back, they're still there. I even tried, ready for this? I pinned a window right here between these two cars in the parking lot. Then I turned and walked away, just left it behind me in the parking lot, walked inside, walked all the way down this long hallway, totally out of sight, around another corner into the studio, and sure enough, that window is still right there where I left it",322.74,621.843,159.09000000000006
Marques Brownlee,hOi8s2wkX4A,VR,Apple,"between those spaces in the parking lot. The only thing holding it back from being nearly perfect is occlusion. Basically, the only thing that ever gets between the window and you is your own arms and hands, which is usually totally fine, but if you have something like around a corner, it doesn't put the wall in between you and the window, which is where it should be. So, sometimes it gets a little wonky, but overall 9 out of 10, already really cool, but the second it gets dinged is when you wanna do this in more than one space. So let's say, at home, I've set up all these suite monitors. I've got a virtual TV in one room and a game and some windows all over the walls or whatever. Cool. I pack it up, I drive here to the studio, and I put it on, and the second I start opening apps here, they have to disappear from home. They basically disappear from any other space and open in your new space. So there is no memory of different older spaces, so when I go back home, my windows are all gonna be gone, and I'll have to set them each individually up again. Not a huge deal, but if it had a memory, wouldn't that just make sense? I wonder if you could set up like little beacons. Like, all it really probably needs is like a QR code or some visual identifier, but basically, you get home, you put the headset on, it sees the beacon, and then it goes, ""Oh, I'm at home,"" and then it puts your windows all the way up where it already knows you usually have them for work, and so you basically just kick back on the couch, put the headset on, and you don't have to re-set up each window in all the same places you want it every single time. It just remembers that. That would be sick. Those two features alone I think would make a dramatic update to how often I realistically would use Vision Pro. Just, I don't know if that requires some Vision OS software update or if you need more compute to do things like more memory of locations or shared computing spaces, but that's the giant things that I think are missing from it that would be awesome. Then the rest of the stuff, on my list anyway, is maybe a little more icing on the cake. Like, here's another one. I think probably 99.99% of people who buy a Vision Pro have an iPhone. I think that's pretty safe. It might be a hundred, but I think that's a reasonable assumption, and I found it interesting. I think a lot of people assume that it'll just connect to the iPhone and they think that they'll be able to see their phone notifications straight away on the Vision Pro, but it's not. It's a separate device like a Mac or an iPad. So, yeah, it'll show you iMessage stuff 'cause that's everywhere, but it is a separate device. But, you know, the obvious difference is, unlike a Mac or an iPad, when you put on a headset, well, now, you're wearing a headset, so if I were to get a phone call on my iPhone,",482.4,621.843,157.31899999999993
Marques Brownlee,hOi8s2wkX4A,VR,Apple,"I couldn't necessarily even see that I'm getting a phone call. There is no notification for it in the Vision Pro, and I'm gonna have to take the headset off to even see it coming and accept that phone call. So it would be nice to have an option where these two things talk to each other a little better. Just maybe a little hub for just my smartphone's notifications over to the side if I wanna check them. I think it makes sense. They probably won't do that though. But here's a number for you. 3,386. That is the pixel density of the Vision Pro's displays. It's kind of a ridiculous number. Over 3,000 pixels per inch each. So there's been some tear-downs. I'll link some below the like buttons. You can see them up close. They're incredibly sharp. So, that and the high refresh rate and minimal distortion all contribute to a pass-through and just everything feeling so real, but the number I'd actually like to improve is 92. So the Vision Pros displays show 92% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. Pretty good coverage. Like, for a display, that's honestly pretty good. The reference grade display that is, like, the Pro Display XCR, for example, that'll show you you 99% of DCI-P3. So, again, it's, for a display, a pretty great number, but the thing about a VR headset is it's replacing your eyes. Like, the pass through is pretty good for what it is, but without getting too complicated, 100% coverage of DCI-P3 is about 50% coverage of all of the colors that the human eye can see. So this headset looks great and it's very sharp, but it's only showing me a little less than half of the colors of reality. So I wonder how much they can improve that, because the human eye is obviously insane. It has crazy dynamic range and foveated rendering and great sharpness and all that fun stuff, but, you know, Apple's been really good at a lot of displays for a long time and these are some incredible displays. So, field of view, wider please, but also, yeah, just generally more color would be interesting. There's lots of other little things that are obvious, like weight reduction please, of course. Higher quality screen recording is a niche little request of mine, but I think would help a lot for people trying to make videos with these things. Also, even more specific, keyboard pass-through while in an environment. So you're in an environment, you're typing, you've got your virtual Mac display, and if it can see and recognize my hands after a scan, I think it would be nice if you could also build in a feature to scan your keyboard or recognize the keyboard of your MacBook, just 'cause it's gonna look the same every time, kind of like my hands. All that being said, I'm sure there are more things that people, you know, are thinking about on their lists, but let me know what you think about Apple Vision Pro gen two. Maybe leave your wishlist in the comments below. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys on the next one. Peace. (lively music)",639.719,621.843,182.60199999999998
Marques Brownlee,CjWfgSrwrz0,VR,Apple,okay so one of the best features of the Vision Pro is how good the object tracking and permanence is but it's a bit of a blessing and a curse see this headset is live mapping the 3D space around you and then when you place an,0.16,621.843,26.279
Marques Brownlee,CjWfgSrwrz0,VR,Apple,object somewhere it stays there like rock solid and it has memory so you can leave windows around your house and then you can leave the room and come back and it'll still be there but if you're in a form of moving Transportation like a,12.96,621.843,23.6
Marques Brownlee,CjWfgSrwrz0,VR,Apple,train or a plane or the back of a car then things do get kind of weird because the visual data for the cameras says you're staying still but the gyroscopes and the accelerometers are saying you're moving so the tracking will fail,24.24,621.843,24.721
Marques Brownlee,CjWfgSrwrz0,VR,Apple,thankfully Apple has actually thought of this and addressed it so there's a feature called travel mode so all you have to do to enable it is pop into the control center and hit that little icon all the way on the left that will,37.2,621.843,21.2
Marques Brownlee,CjWfgSrwrz0,VR,Apple,deactivate a few of the sensors like the gyroscope and still be able to pin permanent objects in your space so that they don't leave as you leave now you can watch movies on a plane,47.84,621.843,24.798000000000002
Marques Brownlee,86Gy035z_KA,VR,Apple,"- I actually love this thing. I love this thing, not because it's flawless or anything, it is far from flawless, but because it's actually interesting. Like, don't forget the last two, three years of Apple Product review comments are just, ""That's boring, oh, it's just a spec bump, there's nothing really new here, oh, they hardly change anything or try anything new these days."" But this, this thing is interesting. It's risky, and most of all, it's new. Now, it's actually not fundamentally new, it's a VR headset, but it's new for Apple. And there are a bunch of things in here that are new in a way that only Apple would try. And just as interesting as this individual product is the possible future that this implies. Like, when you get a first generation product like this, you sort of automatically assume that there are goals for its future, that it'll have another generation and another one after that, and that there is some goal for what this will turn into 10 years down the road because we saw what happened with the iPhone and the Mac and the iPad and all sorts of other first generation products. And on top of all of that, as far as I know, Apple has never released any other first generation product with the word Pro already in the name, which comes with a whole nother set of implications. So is the world ready for all of this? Let's get into it. (upbeat music) So I might be one of the 20 people outside of Apple who has been using the Vision Pro the most over the past two weeks. Like, I've spent hours in this thing with both bands, with multiple Macs, in different setups, different rooms, indoors and outdoors, lightness and darkness. There are parts of this thing that are absolutely amazing, unparalleled, best I've ever seen. But the reason it's so interesting is because it's actually new and there are downfalls and flaws and trade-offs that come alongside all of this stuff. So at the end of the last video, I gave you guys a sort of a preview of my pros and cons list. If you haven't already watched that video, it is definitely worth watching, almost like a prequel to this one. It is a 30 minute monster all about how to use this thing, how it works, what's inside, what it's capable of. And then, at the end, I got to my upsides, which are immersiveness, placement and space, eye tracking and hand control, passthrough, ecosystem, and spatial audio. And the downsides, which are weight and comfort, the eyes on the outside, app selection right now, battery life, and price. So, okay, for starters, I wanna amend immersiveness to fidelity, I think that's more accurate here. I have used a bunch of different VR headsets now, and this Vision Pro has the sharpest, best looking micro-OLED display out of all of them. The size of individual pixels on these displays is seven and a half microns, which means you could fit 64 of them in the size of a single iPhone screen's pixel. You can't see individual pixels, there's no screen door effect, it's awesome. The native refresh rate is 90 hertz and it will crank up to 96 hertz when there's 24 FPS content playing to be an even multiple. And Apple says that they calibrate every single one of these Vision Pro displays from the factory for maximum color accuracy. They're really good, and this is a big reason why this headset is so expensive. But then, and this is gonna be a recurring theme here, the Vision Pro runs up against the technology of today not being quite advanced enough to accomplish what they were probably hoping as ideal. So in the case of these screens, right, they're amazing, there are so many pixels, but because there's so many pixels, the computer inside cannot actually render everything in high resolution all the time at 90 Hertz. So instead, it does something clever. It combines the insanely fast eye tracking with what's called foveated rendering, meaning, it's only actually rendering in high resolution exactly what you're looking at when you're looking at it. The rest is soft and fuzzy. That actually works really well because that's exactly how our eyes work. It's really clever, like you don't think about it, but the thing that you're looking at at the moment is sharp, but then the rest of your peripheral vision is soft and fuzzy, and that's fine. So really, now, all of the computing work is being done to track your eyes as fast as possible so that there's no lag between when you look at something and when it becomes sharp. Fun fact, you can actually see this in screen recordings from the Vision Pro. You can see the piece of the screen that I'm looking at is sharp, and then everything else around it, even parts of the same window are fuzzy on purpose. But to my eye, that looks totally natural because I'm focusing on one thing at a time. I found that you can also screen record with developer mode in Xcode, and that'll make the clips 4K and it'll render everything in HQ all at once. But every time I did that, it would be choppy and scrolling would be slow and jittery.",0.133,621.843,298.8290000000002
Marques Brownlee,86Gy035z_KA,VR,Apple,"And I'm thinking that's just because the computers aren't really used to rendering everything in high quality all the time. So it looks like a higher quality recording, but the second I did any scrolling, it didn't look as good, so I just didn't use those recordings as often. So the screens are great, the position tracking of objects and space are great, the eye tracking is incredibly good. The one ding against immersion on the Vision Pro though, and not a lot of people are talking about this, but it's the field of view. See, the first few times you use this headset, you don't even really think about it that much. You're so distracted by all the fun and the newness and how cool it is that your eyes are controlling the thing. But eventually, you start to poke around the edges and it turns out, you know how people are saying it kind of looks like ski goggles from the outside? Well, it also kind of looks like ski goggles from the inside a little bit too. Again, the middle is super sharp and incredibly impressive, but if I can do my best here through a YouTube video, the edges of the headset are a little bit further in than the edges of your vision. And so, there's a little bit of like a cone effect going on and there's some chromatic aberration around the outside. So you kind of have this slight feeling of looking into a large tunnel at everything. There are actually no field of view numbers published by Apple anywhere about Vision Pro, as far as I can tell, and I kind of think that's on purpose because I have noticed from using them both that the Quest 3 has a better, wider field of view just looking inside the headset. So if I could change one thing about the Vision Pro to make it more immersive, it would be a wider field of view, no question. (upbeat music) Vision Pro has the best passthrough of any headset I've ever used, that much is super clear to me, and weirdly enough, this doesn't actually surprise me either. Maybe because this is one of the products that makes it so obvious that they're thinking a lot about the future, like Apple talks a lot about AR and how they want things to just be clear and just overlaying things onto your real world. But with today's technology, again, that's not quite possible yet. So instead they have a VR headset, but they are using the highest quality camera feeds possible and the highest quality displays on the inside possible to let you almost feel like you're looking through it at the real world. So you put this headset on, and the first thing you see is passthrough, I mean, you might as well call it transparency mode. And the sharpness and the colors and the very low latency are all so good that I really don't experience any eye fatigue, no matter how long I am in this passthrough mode, despite my eyes being inches from these screens, I can interact with the real world around me, pick things up and look at them, I can walk around, between rooms and not trip on things. I tried having people throw things at me and I could just catch them. I played table tennis successfully with the headset on, which is crazy if you think about what's actually happening here. The total latency Apple says is 12 milliseconds, that's from the outside light hitting the outside sensors to the inside image being updated and hitting your eyeballs, that's incredibly fast, and that includes the exposure time of the cameras. That's the specially designed R1 chip at work. But, as Nilay from The Verge has put it, it's still cameras and screens, like the technology of today isn't magic. So you still have to expose a camera sensor and set ISO and shutter speed, et cetera, and you can kind of play around with this a bit just by looking around like at bright objects or high dynamic range environments. And you know what, for the variety of situations I've thrown at this thing, it's handled it very impressively the whole time, mostly prioritizing smoothness and high shutter speeds at the expense of cranking up the ISO and getting way more noise, especially in darker environments. But you can still see stuff like the hand occlusion breaks sometimes or look really janky when you put your hand in front of something. You can still see objects start to float a little bit more in X, Y, and Z space when you're in much lower lighting, as opposed to the usual perfect position. Again, it's the best I've ever seen with today's tech, but it definitely still has a long way to go. (upbeat music) So honestly, the ecosystem is, I would say, the strongest argument for a regular person going out and buying today's version of the Vision Pro. Like, every time a new big product comes out or whatever, I get like texts from people, ""Oh hey, Marques, you know, I know you already made like a 30 minute video about it and like unboxed it and did all that, but like what do you really think about the Vision Pro? Like, is it good enough? Should I get one?"" And, truthfully, probably not. But I will say that there are a good amount of things that I do specifically look forward to using for it, and most of those things are ecosystem related. So obviously there's the built-in apps, right? iMessage works perfectly,",309.63,621.843,287.23500000000007
Marques Brownlee,86Gy035z_KA,VR,Apple,"just like any iPhone or iPad on your account, photos are all loaded up in here straight from your iPhone. This is clearly the headset that is best for iPhone users, Apple ecosystem people, but also, little things too, like continuity. So I can copy some text on my Mac or my iPhone and then hit Paste and it shows up in the Vision Pro. But there's two really impressive ones to me for very different specific reasons, FaceTime and Mac Virtual Display. See, FaceTime is the most only Apple could ship this thing I've seen in a long time. From the personas scanned in from the cameras on the front of the headset to the positional tracking and responsiveness of the spatial audio, it's all so well thought out that, you know, once everyone on the call gets past the initial like, ""Ah, what is this?"" The shock, the moment they first see the virtual version of you, once they first get past that, then it actually kind of slowly gets easier and it feels way more like a normal conversation than a normal FaceTime. And it trades the downside of not being able to hold up objects to your camera for a button that can switch to a real time first person view where you can use both hands instead of one. Does the audio from these speakers still bleed out into the rest of the world so anything over half volume is incredibly audible to everyone in the room around you? Yeah, but does it also still sound really, really impressive for not actually being real headphones? Yeah. But the other thing is Mac Virtual Display. This is my number one favorite feature of the Vision Pro, even over like watching movies and stuff. Now, first of all, yes, you can already do remote desktop viewing on something like a Quest 3, it's great, I love that too. But this one is way more interesting. So this is connecting to your Mac and then intaking and re-rendering a new virtual display for your Mac, not mirroring what's already being shown by your computer. So you can use your Mac with all of its existing controls you're already using with it, but make your new monitor literally as big as you want. And then, you can open up simultaneous Vision Pro apps all around that Mac display and place them all around the room wherever you want, over the walls, floating in midair, pin them to other objects, whatever, you can go nuts. Now, is this perfect? No, there are definitely trade-offs. From even the little things, like not being able to see your keyboard when you're in an immersive environment, to only being able to have a single virtual Mac monitor at a time, to always having to look where you're controlling, I keep telling you guys, there's definitely extra brain cycles involved here. But I do still think that, despite all that, this is my number one favorite feature of this Vision Pro. The number one thing that you can buy it for and do that you couldn't do with any other Apple product. I mean, it's the difference between looking like this in a coffee shop or looking like this in a coffee shop. Pick your poison, I guess. I also had a moment where I was using the Vision Pro for a while and I had my Mac and some other monitors around me, and then I took it off and then I went and did something and then I came back, and before I put the headset back on, I looked up at the wall to where I thought a window was gonna be, but I hadn't, I hadn't... I don't know if that says more about the headset or about me. (upbeat music) But speaking of apps, we gotta get into the weaknesses. And the app situation on Vision Pro right now is one of them. So this is the home screen of the Vision Pro, it has all of your apps, you can't rearrange them, it's always alphabetical. And this is a developing situation that will record and improve over time, but as of right now, as I record this on launch day, there are literally 600 apps made for the Vision Pro. And that sounds like a lot at first, but then kind of not a lot. There are also the millions of other apps that are made for the iPad that are compatible with the Vision Pro that will show up. But there's 600 apps made specifically for the Vision Pro. The few apps that are showing up here are pretty incredible, and they all kind of find unique and creative ways to take advantage of the 3D space. And I fully believe the rest of the developers are also kind of still trying to figure out what to do with the 3D space in their own apps, or even if it makes sense to do anything at all beyond the normal iPad app. But at this point right now today, I honestly believe that there are way more cool ideas about VR and AR experiences than there are actual apps. Now, don't get me wrong, there are some cool apps, and like I said, I've shown some in the past video, there are some more in this video and there will be more of them pop up every day. But have you seen that video of gamifying vacuum cleaning so that you can actually cover your entire floor space like a game? It's not a real app, but if it was, it would be pretty sick and I would totally use it. Or maybe you've seen that other video",598.68,621.843,290.89699999999993
Marques Brownlee,86Gy035z_KA,VR,Apple,"of watching an F1 race in Vision Pro, it is so sick, it's like there's a virtual track overlaid into your space so you can keep track of everything happening at once, plus the times and, you know, smaller video feeds of the battles around different points of the track. This looks genuinely better than the actual TV broadcast experience, but it's also not a real app yet, it's just a concept. And I've seen all kinds of other stuff and I wanna watch an NBA game court side in the Vision Pro too, but that experience doesn't seem to exist yet either. Whatever it is about like Apple jumping into this new space and all the implications of like, oh, okay, the tech is gonna start to get better now, this sort of unlocked this new creative layer for people to dream of new AR and VR experiences, and it'll be up to developers to actually make that stuff happen over time, with the constraints of today's technology. But as of right now, not a lot of apps, also, no YouTube app, no Netflix app, there's no Spotify app, there's no TikTok app yet. I hope that Apple can sort of patch up the relationship with these developers because getting those apps will make this a better product. But as of right now, that is definitely a weakness of this first gen product. (upbeat music) All right, I'm not the only one who's been saying this, but this is not the most comfortable headset and I figured out why. So first of all, everyone's mentioned the weight, and it's true, it does weigh like 25% more than a lot of other headsets. Like, take the Quest 3, for example, probably the most popular one, familiar to most people, that's mostly plastic and it weighs 515 grams. So Vision Pro being made of metal and having all this glass, weighing in at nearly 650 grams, it kind of seems like Apple just didn't care about the weight. But I don't think that's the case. Matter of fact, if you've seen the tear downs or if you've seen what's inside this little computer here on your face, this is built incredibly efficiently. There's carbon fiber in here, magnesium, all sorts of other lightweight materials. Now there's still lots of obvious heft on it, but 25% more weight shouldn't be the difference between comfortable and, like, I need to do neck exercises. No, the problem is this strap, this is the Solo Knit strap, this is the strap that's in all the commercials that everybody sees. This is what's on Apple's website, it's in all the Apple stores because it looks so cool. And I think when Apple was probably first deciding, okay, we are gonna get into this VR headset market, how do we differentiate ourselves? We gotta reinvent a few things, like the input method and all this stuff. I think they thought the strap had to be one of them, and that's how we got this thing. And I think Dave2D was spot on in his recent video, VR headsets just kind of all look dumb, and the straps on them are all so universally lame looking. And this strap is just so much cooler, you put it on, it's the quickest to adjust, it messes up your hair the least. It obviously has this little adjustment thing on the outside so you can scroll this wheel and satisfyingly like tighten the cables inside like this. This must have taken a lot of R&D to get this thing to look iconic and actually be functional, this is sick. But when you put it on, you sort of tighten it up against the front of your face and it's squeezing it up against your face, all of the weight, up at the front against basically these two pressure points, right above your eyes and right on your cheeks. And the more you tighten it to prevent light leak, the more uncomfortable it gets. And it's just, it's so hard to wear this for more than about 30, 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, I really do need to take this off. So it's not your neck as much as it's just all the pressure on the front of your face. And Apple knows this, and that's why they've included in the box this second band, this is the dual loop band, and it's super easy to pop this one off and pop this one on. Now it's not as cool looking as a Solo Knit Band, and it's going to mess up your hair more than a Solo Knit Band, and it's not as easy to adjust as a Solo Knit Band. You're literally like trying to find and attach Velcro blindly at the top of your head. Basically, it's almost as lame looking as every other VR headset strap. But it turns out they all look like this for a reason, and oh my God, is it so much better for wearing it for a long time. I just recently did the last episode of the ""Waveform Podcast"", you can go subscribe over there. I wore the headset for the entire thing, a two hour recording, and I could never have done that with the Solo Knit Band, and that's because it's taking a ton of the pressure off of the front of your face and taking the weight and using the top of your head to support it instead. It's so much better. So if you're gonna just hand the headset to someone to use it for like five minutes, the Solo Knit Band is great 'cause it's super quick, doesn't mess up their hair, easy to adjust, boom.",892.86,621.843,295.75600000000003
Marques Brownlee,86Gy035z_KA,VR,Apple,"But if you plan on using this thing for an extensive period of time, yeah, the dual loop band is 100% the way to go. (upbeat music) So I don't know if the eyes on the outside of this headset are actually accomplishing what Apple probably wanted them to accomplish. I think this, again, comes down to what we expect Vision Pro to be in the future, see through glasses, way down the line. But that's obviously not possible with today's tech, so the closest we can get is a lenticular display that shows your eyes to the outside world, and so that you can see them and they can kind of see you. I don't know, at this point, I've tried my eyes, but also everyone else here at the studio has also scanned themselves in and tried EyeSight, and it's just not very visible. Like, the smooth glass of the headset is so incredibly reflective that there's almost always some light bouncing off it in a way that makes the eyes hard to see. And even if you can see it, it's pretty low resolution, thanks to the lenticular display, and the bottom line is it doesn't actually feel like eye contact most of the time, which is very different from what you might have seen in the ads, especially for darker skin tones. And I was actually thinking about this like, this is so far from what I think I expected that I was wondering, does Apple in the next generation Vision Pro double down on EyeSight or do they get rid of it? And I think they have to keep it, like it's such an iconic part of the headset that everyone's expecting it to stay, so it's gotta be there. But also, this is Vision Pro and I think that implies that we're gonna get Apple Vision at some point down the road, which is like a less expensive version of this. And with that, do you take out EyeSight or does that still appear in the lower end version? I don't know, only time will tell. (upbeat music) So, all right, look, at the end of the day, when I'm answering those texts about what do people wanna know what I really think about Vision Pro, I think the Vision Pro is a really expensive, really fun toy. Like, this is an incredibly fun piece of tech to play with, and I am loving watching the pieces of media built specifically for Vision Pro, I am loving playing some of the new early games that are taking advantage of the 3D space and the hand controls, I am loving the idea of getting on a plane and editing videos on my Mac or watching a movie on a gigantic screen while the person next to me can't see any of what I'm doing. That stuff is all so sick. And if you're actually thinking about buying one, I think you should be able to expect to enjoy all of that same stuff too. But definitely still note that all of the symptoms of a first generation product are definitely also still here. It's heavy, it's not a lot of apps, the battery life is meh and it's expensive. So here's the bigger question, is the Vision Pro a guaranteed success in the future? Because the first generation iPhone had all of the same downfalls in its generation, and look at where we are now. So, also, same with the watch, same with the iPad. But here's the thing, you can't just say the other stuff had problems and it became successful, therefore, this one having problems also means it's successful. It doesn't work that way, there has to be something about this that people actually like that makes 'em willing to overlook the first generation downfalls. And I think this has it, I think it has, I honestly, it's kind of just the sci-fi, fun nature of like controlling things with your hands, moving windows around the room, the sci-fi movie energy, you've seen it, you're probably already thinking of a certain movie that has that sort of energy, this has that. And the fact that these ideas of what people wanna do in VR are so universally well liked and so cool, that means that there's something here, there's something that people want, even in this first generation. Now, will all this new attention on VR headsets in general shine a lot of light on all of the other much cheaper competitors that you should probably buy instead of this one, like the $500 Quest 3? Yeah. Now, will all this new developer attention in this VR/AR space bring a lot of way cooler, way more awesome applications that will rapidly improve the value proposition of this $3,500 first gen headset? Yeah. Should you go out and buy one of these if you've got the money and you saw one or two really cool looking apps that you wanna try from the videos? Sure, why not? It's your money. But I'm already very excited for the next generation. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one, peace. (bright music)",1189.5,621.843,288.462
Marques Brownlee,dtp6b76pMak,VR,Apple,"(upbeat music) - All right, so you've seen the unboxing. Now it's time for the breakdown. What is using the Apple Vision Pro actually like? This is easily one of Apple's craziest, most radical, possibly dystopian products of all time. And I have a lot of thoughts here, like I've been using it for about a week now. There are some parts of this thing that are absolutely incredible, and some other parts that feel weird, or borderline unfinished. There are all kinds of new technologies, from a new operating system to infrared eye tracking to virtually reconstructed versions of you. I feel like there are so many actually new things that you have to understand in order to get a sense of what this headset actually is and what it does. So I'm gonna break this down into two parts. This video is all about using the Vision Pro. It's everything I've learned from the past week of wearing and getting used to this thing every single day. But I'm also working on a more wide ranging, possibly more existential, review video. But let's just start with the more hardware fundamentals, right? Like what is this thing that I'm holding literally? Apple Vision Pro at its core, well, it is a VR headset. Now, Apple would never say that, and they probably won't like that I'm saying that word. You know, I made an entire video about why they refuse to use those words, and they're calling it spatial computing instead. We'll get there. But the truth is it's a really, really, really high end virtual reality headset. It's something we've seen before, right? It's got displays and lenses and speakers and fans and buttons. And this is a form factor. This is a thing that we have seen before, but before I even turn this thing on, there are clearly several things that are a little different about this one. So first of all, it's made of metal. Lots of metal and glass here, which are high quality, but heavy materials, relatively speaking. So there's this precisely machined aluminum frame around the outside. And yes, those are intakes for fans at the bottom. And then vents for those fans at the top. On the right side, there's your digital crown that can be pressed in or turned. And then on the other side is just a single larger button. So kind of basically the same two buttons as an Apple Watch. And then when you get a little further back on this band here, these little pods with downward facing grills, these are speakers which are pointed straight at your ears, and work surprisingly well. Though of course, it also means that people around you can hear a little bit of what you're hearing. There's a little bit of bleed, and I have a lot to say about spatial audio, so stay tuned for that. But the main event is at the front. There is an enormous piece of glass, which, yes, is very easy to fingerprint and smudge. And then behind that thing, there's this outward-facing OLED display and a bunch of sensors all the way around, outside facing sensors that go forward, sideways, and straight down. And there's depth sensors, infrared illuminators, lidar scanners, and just regular old RGB cameras, all being processed by an M2 chip and an R1 chip inside this thing. And then maybe the craziest part, inside the headset, there are a bunch more sensors facing your eyes, tracking your eyes in real time, for all the eye control and everything that comes with that. And also then to display a representation of your eyes on the outside of the headset. Kinda, we'll get there. But overall, when you put it all together, you get a very well made, very high end, but also pretty heavy computer to wear on your face. So officially, this headset with this solo knit band when I weighed it, showed up as 638 grams, which some of you on Twitter have already pointed out is actually slightly less than the plastic Meta Quest Pro. But that Quest Pro also has a lot of battery on the back of your head as a sort of a counterbalance, so the weight distribution is very different. Also, the Quest Pro is not that comfortable anyway. But the point is this, for Apple, made the choice of taking the battery off of the headset, which means okay, now there's nothing on the back of your head, so you can wear it and lean up against things, and that might be an upside, but that also now means you have to deal with this cable all the time running up to your head, and the fact that it's very front weighted now. All of the weight is on the front of your face. So this is the battery, as you saw in the unboxing. If you haven't already seen the unboxing, that just went up. I'll link it below the like button. But this battery is a surprisingly small 3,366 milliamp hours. I say surprisingly small because a normal battery bank of this size, you might expect to be 10, 15, 20,000 milliamp hours. I suspect there's a lot of heat insulation happening here. But it comes with a non-removable four foot cable, and a proprietary connector at the end of the cable that will twist and lock to the headset. And so the lock is really solid. It makes sense that it's not just straight USB that could get disconnected easily. Once you connect it, it starts glowing, and then it starts booting up. And there's even a little Apple logo that displays on the outside screen while it takes, you know, a little under a minute to turn on. So there is no on or off button or switch anywhere on this headset. Maybe kind of like AirPods Max or something like that. So if you ever take the headset off and put it down, it will enter a standby mode after some time, but it won't turn off. If you wanna turn it off, you literally have to twist and unplug the cable. That's the only way to actually turn the headset off. Now famously already, the battery life with this included battery, is not super long on this headset. Two to four hours is actually realistic for what you can expect for just like this built-in battery. But that's also kind of right in line with a lot of other VR headsets. Battery life on VR headsets is not that great in general. If you do wanna use it longer, the only way to do that is there's USBC port on the battery, and you have to plug the battery in. So you could plug the battery into the wall for infinite battery life, or I guess you could plug it into like a, you could daisy chain another battery into the other pocket or something for even longer life. But yeah, two to four hours. Now at first it seemed weird to me that the port is on the same side of the battery as the non-removable cable, but I think it's because they just want you to default to putting this battery in your pocket, probably in your back pocket. So even if it's plugged into the wall, it can still be in your back pocket. You're just gonna want to get a longer USBC cable. So there are no controllers that come with this headset. Now it does support other input methods that are like game controllers, and mouse, and keyboard, and those can be incredibly useful, but by default the primary input method for everyone using the Vision Pro is your eyes and your hands. So the first time you put on this headset, it goes through this calibration process, and it's pretty interesting. So the first time you ever put it on, it first adjusts the distance between the lenses, physically moving them inside the headset to match the distance between your eyes. Then it does this sort of a hand scan so it understands your hands. And then you go through this process of basically looking at a bunch of dots all the way around the screen, and then tapping your fingers together to select them. Kind of feels like an eye test or something. And then you're in. So first thing you're gonna notice is you can actually kind of put your hands anywhere as long as the headset can see this, just your fingers touching together.",0.107,621.843,433.1260000000003
Marques Brownlee,dtp6b76pMak,VR,Apple,"So there's a lot of pictures of people using a headset with their fingers, like out in front of them, pinching like that. But you actually don't have to do that. It's such a wide angle because of the sensors facing forward and sideways and down. You can kind of just rest your hand anywhere, in front of you, in your lap. As long as you pinch like that, it can generally pick it up, which is impressive. So you're pinching to control anywhere in that 180 degree bubble in front of you. And then the digital crown, you hit that once, and the app drawer comes up, pretty simple. Doesn't seem that impressive. But this is actually a peek at the first really impressive thing about this headset to me, which is it seems to have incredible spatial positioning lock, and like, it's really hard to have you appreciate this through a YouTube video. Reviewing VR headsets is hard. But turn around in the room you're in, and picture a wall or a window just appearing locked in place in 3D space in your room, and no matter how much you move your head, or move around, it stays exactly kind of floating where it's supposed to be. But when I say floating, I think you're picturing like a, a soft float, but it's locked, and that's how it starts. So now you're in Apple's new Vision OS I would describe this as kind of similar to iPad OS, but way more glassy, and of course with the extra dimension of 3D space. So hitting a digital crown will always get the app drawer back in front of you, and then simply look at the icon you want and pinch your fingers together, to select it and open that app. Scrolling is basically as you'd expect, you just kind of pinch and grab in the air, and then pull as if it's on a string, and physics let you pull things through the air. It's pretty intuitive, it's responsive, it's fluid. Sometimes it's kind of bouncy even. I would say the biggest adjustment is only being able to control exactly what you're looking at. And I don't think people realize how often they're controlling things that they're not exactly looking directly at with other computers and other UIs. But with this, you can look at the button to select it, and if you look at the next thing you're gonna do, you're no longer controlling the button. You have to look exactly where you're trying to interact with things. It takes a few extra brain cycles to remember to always be looking exactly at the thing you're controlling. So when you open a window of a Vision OS app, like any one of the default Apple apps here, it locks into place, it's floating there. It kind of looks, again, like an iPad app, but very glassy, like this frosted glass around the UI sort of lets you see through a little bit to the color behind it. And it even sometimes casts a shadow on the ground in the correct Z space, so it really solidifies that it's floating in front of you. All this makes it feel like the window is in the space around you. Then if you look at the bottom of the window, you get a little bar, you can always just look at that bar and pinch to drag it around. So drag it forward, backward, anywhere you want in X, Y, and Z space, and then let go and it just stays absolutely locked. And then you can look at either bottom corner to resize to make it bigger or smaller. And then finally there's a little X at the bottom, you select that, that closes it. So that is the basics of Vision OS, and just using an app. Now this entire time, by default, and almost any time they can, passthrough is on, which means you have the headset on, but you can see with the cameras right through to everything around you. And I think this is where Apple really wants to normalize the term spatial computing, because it feels like augmented reality. It feels like you're always able to see the space around you, but technically it's not actually AR, because you are still looking at a reconstructed version through a camera feed of the world around you instead of the actual world around you. But maybe it's all just semantics. I will say, this is the best passthrough of any VR headset I've ever used, and it's not even that close. Now again, it's so hard to get this through a YouTube video. It does have screen recording built in, so I'm gonna try to use that. But imagine putting a headset on, and not really feeling like you're looking at a screen with the real world. Because of the pixel density, because of the 90 hertz refresh rate, and because of the impressive dynamic range of the cameras and the correctly adjusting shutter speed, you just almost don't, you almost just feel like you're looking at the real world, not through a headset. Also the passthrough is so close to real time that I could legitimately interact with all kinds of things. I could catch items flying at me. I even tried playing ping pong. It was easy, no hesitation. So officially, the R1 chip is doing all the processing of all this stuff and adjusting the shutter speed for different lighting conditions and always keeping passthrough latency under 12 milliseconds, which is the lowest in the industry. But it's really combining that with how close to reality the colors and brightness and everything are that keeps it feeling kind of real. Basically, the only noticeable restriction is super close up items and objects can get a bit blurry, and then you can't quite make out really small or fine texts, so you can't read an email or a tiny text on your phone in your hand, but you can absolutely text people, or read your notifications, while keeping the headset on. If you've tried other VR headsets, you know how impressive that is. It's just, it's really good with the tech that exists now for VR headsets. But you can definitely still take the headset off and be like, oh, it's way brighter in here than I thought it was. Either way, that's all passthrough, but if you ever wanna fully immerse yourself, I mean it is a VR headset after all, all you gotta do is rotate this digital crown clockwise, just keep turning it, and it will slowly dial your environment more and more into your field of view until you dial it all the way up to fully surrounding you. So all of the windows you might have had open will still stay stuck where they were, but everything you're doing is just on the moon now. So yeah, there's a couple environments Apple has built in here, most of them relaxing scenic locations, like in California somewhere, or one really nice one is Mount Hood with a little bit of rain falling. They're not quite photorealistic, but they're just short of photorealistic, like they're the most realistic digital environments that I've seen. So then the last two big quirks of the UI, control center. So the only way to get to control center is to look up, and you can't just look up, but you have to physically turn your head up and look at this arrow that appears above you. So once you see that, you select that and then you get your control center for things like, you know, battery life and notifications, focus modes, and screen recording, and pairing to a Mac. But the other big quirk is text input. So you might be wondering how does text input work with no physical controllers? So there's basically three ways to do this. So let's say you are in Safari, and you want to go to mkbhd.com. You really want one of those shiny new Chevron hoodies for the rest of winter. Great, how do you do it? So the first way is to literally hunt and peck poking the keys on the keyboard that appears in the air in front of you. So this one is tough, because it literally only reacts to your pointer finger on each hand. So you actually can't type fast, like with home row or anything like that. Not great. The second way, though, I think is actually kind of good.",436.89,621.843,430.62600000000015
Marques Brownlee,dtp6b76pMak,VR,Apple,"It's at least faster, which is looking at the key you want to interact with, and then pinching to select it. So just looking around the keyboard like this, and selecting the keys. And you might be surprised how fast you can type like this if you actually know your way around a keyboard pretty well. I actually prefer this to poking the virtual keys because I at least get a little bit of haptic feedback from my own fingers tapping together. But then in Safari, the last way to do it is literally to just look up at the microphone and say the URL out loud. MKBHD.com. And then it just hears you and goes to the site pretty quick, if it's a URL that you can actually say out loud. So, what can you actually do with this thing? Like now that we know what it is, it's the M2 chip, a computer on your face with the displays and the lenses inside, and all sorts of sensors everywhere. What can this thing actually do? And I feel like the most common way to phrase that is what is the killer app? Because that's, we feel like we need some sort of justification to spend three, $4,000 on this thing. Like applications made the iPhone what it is as we know it, like apps made the iPad. So what is the app situation on the Vision Pro? So there are two types of apps on the Vision Pro, actually. The first is apps that are built specifically for the Vision Pro to take advantage of its awesome experiences. And there are a few of those right now, and then there are all the other apps, which basically are iPhone and iPad apps that happen to be compatible because the developer didn't opt out. And the first kind is way cooler. So these are Apple's stock apps here that come with the Vision Pro. And so these are all, of course, made just for Vision Pro. So they're gonna have stuff that takes full advantage of what this thing is capable of. Apple Music is a pretty classic one, like it has all the same functionality of any other Apple Music app, but in this super glassy frosted window, and shows the colors of whatever's behind it. And you have the sort of sorting menu on the left hand side instead of across the bottom. That's the basic layout. Same thing with the Notes app and the Settings app. Very glassy, almost looking like an iPad app in the air, just rebuilt with this new material design. And then there's the media apps. So Apple TV and Disney+, they both come pre-installed, which they have built entire environments inside of them for watching media. And there's even a small collection of videos on the Apple TV app that are shot on a new proprietary format specifically for Vision Pro. So it drops you into a space with a full 180 degree video, and Alicia Keys walks right up to you and starts singing right to your face. It's crazy. There's also the Photos app, which will let you look at panoramic photos, for example, in this fully immersive view. So you can blow them up to full screen, and then it gives you a bit of a parallax effect around the edges, so it feels like you're looking into a window of your own photo and looking around. It's kind of incredible. And then there's also some other really fun third party apps that I've tried that were built ahead of time. So Sky Guide, this is a good one. You can look around a real representation of the sky around you or any of the constellations would normally be, you can look at it a little longer and it'll pop it out. You can pull it outta the sky to get more information about it. It's a pretty great idea. There's another one called Jig Space, which is, it's a sick app, I don't know if I'd ever use it, but basically it lets you load 3D models into the space you're in and mess around with them, take 'em apart, view them in actual size. And this really takes advantage of how good the placement lock is on the Vision Pro. And you can walk around, and really gets you a better understanding of the scale of things that you don't get to see up close very often. And then Keynote is another funny one. So you can of course go through and edit a Keynote just like normal if you want to, but then they've built this whole environment for practicing your presentation skills. So you press that and it says, oh, would you like to go to a conference room, or the literal Steve Jobs Theater, so you can rehearse talking to your audience with your Keynote slides behind you. It is genuinely incredibly immersive. And there's already a bunch more apps like this in the App Store already at launch that are specifically built for Vision Pro. So they'll take advantage of its various strengths. Now, are any of these a killer app? Not really. I mean I don't, if you're looking for any one of these to be the reason why you spend like $4,000 on this headset, I don't think we have that yet. But then at least there's all the other non-native, but technically still compatible, apps that are in the App Store. And these are gonna look just like iPhone and iPad apps. Actually, there's a pre-installed folder on the home screen when you get this thing literally called Compatible Apps, and there's a bunch of them from Apple here. They look exactly like iPad apps. I'm surprised actually that more of them aren't fully built out to take advantage of Vision Pro, but like, Apple Maps is just the iPad app. And so it would be cool if there were some fun augmented reality overlay walking directions type stuff, but nope, it's all the exact same functionality that you would find if you opened this app on your iPad. And you can go to the App Store and search a bunch of the names of apps you already know and love, and find them by name and grab them, and they'll work the exact same way. Crazily enough though, there are already some notable exceptions. No Netflix app for the Vision Pro, no YouTube app for the Vision Pro, no Spotify app for the Vision Pro. Apple has kind of a contentious relationship with a lot of developers right now, especially some of the bigger ones. And so some have made the active choice to opt out. They're like, we don't wanna be there. This won't be a big enough platform to matter to us to justify the work. So they're not there. Now I totally get it, but also now as a Vision Pro owner and someone who's using it, I'm like, oh, it's kind of a bummer. I really wanted to be able to watch a Netflix show offline, downloaded it ahead of time, but you can't do that now. But at least, at least for now, for the record, you can use the browser, and anything that would work in the browser. So if you pull up Safari, and you get a full screen 4K YouTube video going, and locked in space, or even in an environment, it looks great. It's razor sharp. Like, I could totally watch YouTube videos like this. But you will definitely be missing the features of having the dedicated app, like offline video. Honestly to me, the killer app of the Vision Pro isn't just an app, it's actually the ecosystem. And we knew this was coming, but the second you log into a Vision Pro with your Apple ID, immediately it starts pulling all the services, and all the stuff that you're used to from all the other Apple devices you already have. And I said this before the Vision Pro was announced, I was like, this is the most obvious strategy for Apple because there are lots of people out there who have never considered buying a VR headset that are considering only this one because they have an iPhone, and this is the one that works with the iPhone, and none of the others are particularly close. So all of your iMessages are already here, all of your photos are already here and loaded up and backed up. All your Notes are already at your fingertips. You already saw the Keynote app. But okay, easily my favorite feature is connecting to your Mac, right? So anytime your Mac is in front of you",869.19,621.843,432.129
Marques Brownlee,dtp6b76pMak,VR,Apple,"and it's turned on, hit that arrow and then there's this little icon to Become My Mac's Virtual Display. So I click that, and then pick my Mac, and it pretty much instantly, it actually blacks out the display of my Mac, and then turns that display into a 4K window inside of the headset. So now my keyboard and trackpad still work, even if it is a desktop. The keyboard and the trackpad still control everything, and you can continue using it just like a normal computer, but with the ability to make your new 4K monitor as big or as small or close or far away as you want, which is super sick. And then the bonus is you can still open up and place other Vision Pro apps around your Mac computer. So like you can have your Mac in the middle here, and maybe you're editing or doing some work on the Mac app, and then you have a Safari window, or Messages, or whatever else you want right next to it around it. And then your keyboard and trackpad can move seamlessly between them all to control all of them. This, to me, as a Mac user, the ease of use for setup to make this happen, this feels like the biggest game changer, like the most compelling futuristic feeling use of this headset to me. Especially on a plane. Oh my god, I can't tell you how many times I've had an awkward conversation because, like, I'm editing a video on the plane, the person next to me sees I'm editing a video of myself, and it's kind of weird and hard to explain, but I'm picturing putting the headset on, the display blacks out, but now I can do all the editing I want, and I can make the screen as big as I want. So I've really enjoyed using that feature. Again, the biggest challenge, though, is still remembering to look exactly at the thing you want to control. So aside from typing on the real keyboard on whatever window is open, if you want to control something, you have to be looking at it. Again, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you try it, you'll see what I mean. And then also, odd limitation, one monitor only. From the Mac, one virtual monitor only at a time. So if you usually run a dual display setup like I do for Final Cut Pro, big preview on one side, timeline on the other side, you can't do that. You have to use the big one monitor version of your setup. All right, so you might have realized I've left one thing out this whole time. One thing, you could call it one more thing, sure. It's one more huge crazy thing, but it's kind of the defining characteristic of this product and that is Personas. So in all the advertising you've seen of Vision Pro, there's these eyes on the outside of the headset that looks like they're kind of in a passthrough, like in a dark astronaut helmet type of thing. Easily the most memed, most unique aspect of this headset, right? It's the only headset with an outward display. And I mean it's very, very prominent in those videos, but in real life, as you've started to see from some of my footage, it is very different, and I think I figured out why. So first of all, it's not actually see-through, right? There's a whole bunch of computer in between me and you right now. So the eyes aren't on the outside. It's a representation of my eyes based on what all the sensors on the inside are seeing. It's reconstructing it on the outside. So those sensors are tracking at 90 frames per second, and they give you optic ID, which is, it's how you log into the headset and keep things secure. It's basically the same as face ID, or touch ID, it's just looking at and identifying your eyes. And it also powers the one beta feature of this headset, which is Personas, which is, it's the most impressive and weirdest thing about this headset at the same time. I'm calling it right now. So the purpose of the eyes on the outside is really not for you, the wearer of the headset. In fact, you'll never see it. But it's for the people around you. So when you're in a passthrough mode, your eyes will shine through to indicate that you wearing the headset can see the person outside. So that right there is already pretty unique. But then, when you're in something immersive and you can't see what's around you, it covers up your eyes with this sort of like a blue, purple glowing animation. So that intuitively makes sense. You can see the eyes when they can see you, you can't see the eyes when they can't see you. But crazily enough, there's also a feature where if you have someone who's outside the headset looking at you, talking to you, and you are in an immersion, but you want to talk to them through that, they will kind of appear through the fog of whatever immersive environment you're in. So you just start talking and looking in their direction. It detects that, and sort of parts a little bit of a fog and that person's eyes will show through the fog. It's pretty decent. It basically only shows one person at a time. And when this is happening on the outside of the headset, it shows a little bit of your eyes poking through the purple and blue glow. It's, as you can see, it's all working, but also, I think it looks nothing like the eyes from the ad. So in an effort to make the eyes as presentable as possible, two things. First of all, this screen is actually behind a lenticular film, which I didn't even realize that from the initial media they had published. But if you've ever heard of that, it's sort of what gives it this 3D depth. You might have seen this on other holographic displays and stuff, but the point of that is to make the eyes appear to be sunken into the display, like on your actual face, instead of glued to the front of the headset, which would look a little more weird. But then two, to represent your actual eyes, they've built in a way to scan in and create a digital representation of your face, which is called your Persona. And it looks like this. So to get those eyes on the outside of the Vision Pro headset, you have to do something called registering your Persona. This is how it creates the digital version of you that includes your eyes that will show up here. So let's do that now. It's actually kind of a cool process. So I'm gonna put it on, and hopefully the screen recording works so you can see exactly what I'm doing. I'll hit the digital crown. I'm gonna go to Settings. And you can do this when you first set it up. But I'm going to Persona, and I'm gonna hit Get Started. So let's refine my hands real quick. This is capturing detail from the front of the headset of the hands in front of me. Once it's done with that- - [Automated Voice] Your Persona, remove Apple Vision Pro. - It's gonna ask me to take it off. So this is how it goes. - [Automated Voice] When you're ready, hold Apple Vision Pro at eye level. Keep your arms and shoulders relaxed. Align your entire face within the frame. - [Marques] My face shows up like face ID. - [Automated Voice] Slowly turn your head to the right. Now slowly turn your head to the left. Now tilt your head up, then tilt your head down. Next, let's capture your facial expressions. Smile with your mouth closed. Then make a big smile with your teeth showing. Now raise your eyebrows. Close your eyes for a moment. Capture complete. Put Vision Pro back on to continue. - I will do that. So now I have a menu that says Creating Persona, and it says it's in beta, and now there's my Persona right there. Kind of uncanny. The hair's a little bit different, but the face. Wow, wow. Okay. So there's different lighting. You can choose it to always be in studio lighting, and always be in contour lighting. I'll just leave it at natural, and hit next. You can change the color temperature of your skin tone.",1304.31,621.843,450.2849999999999
Marques Brownlee,dtp6b76pMak,VR,Apple,"Cool to warm, I think I'm around there. Brightness, darkness. I think I'm around there, near the middle. Next. And then I can add glasses. So if I typically have glasses, which obviously I wouldn't be able to wear in the Vision Pro, you can still look like you have glasses, anytime you're on that FaceTime call. And then next. Save. And that's it. So I think now you should see my eyes. Maybe. And that that's the thing, it barely shows up. You can barely see my eyes when I'm wearing the headset. Now I've tried a couple other scans subsequently, so I've tried different lighting conditions, I've tried different backgrounds, simple backgrounds, tried different shirts and things like that. It doesn't really ever appear any brighter. I think if you have a darker skin tone like me, just don't expect the eyes to show up very brightly on the outside of the headset. It's pretty subtle. Even when it does show up, it's a little weird looking. The eyes are a little too far apart sometimes. They're a little dim. You see one eye at a time. It's kind of weird. But that Persona though. Whew. That is some pretty interesting stuff. It's crazy that this is actually a real thing being shipped, like first Meta started doing it. Now Apple's doing this. This is, again, it's technically in beta. So I dunno, there's room for improvement, but it still works. But as of right now, I feel like this is both incredibly impressive and slightly unsettling. Like, it's very impressive that this thing, this headset I'm wearing on my face, is tracking all these little micro expressions and little movements for my eyes and my cheeks and my mouth and everything. But at the same time, it's just not quite human. It's right at the edge of the uncanny valley of I'm not looking at a person. So yeah. But the crazy part is you can now use this Persona as your camera feed for any apps in Vision Pro that require a front facing camera, like FaceTime. And so I've tried, I've been using FaceTime a few times in the Vision Pro, and it is, technically speaking, incredible. So I've made a few FaceTime calls in the past few days with some fellow reviewers, who you'll probably recognize from their Personas, who are also testing the Vision Pro. And universally, once we all got past the shock of, oh my god, it's you. It looks like a digital version of you. This is crazy. I've never seen anything like this before. Once we got past that, there is a ton happening here. So you can see the FaceTime windows literally appear as just that. They're just like glassy windows floating in space with people looking through them. And then the angle that you look into the window is gonna match the angle that they see you looking at them. Meaning if we're all in Vision Pros on this call, unlikely, but hear me out. If we're all in Vision Pros, and you've got a bunch of people on this FaceTime call, so there's somebody to the left, and somebody to the right, if I look to the person, and make eye contact with the person to the right, the person to the left sees the side of my head, because I'm looking at somebody else. That's already pretty cool. And then the same thing is true for hand gestures. So we tried this out. Turns out you can reach out and make hand gestures that are tracked by the cameras in this bubble in front of you, and they show up at the correct angle towards the person that you're gesturing at, so not towards everybody else on the call. Oh wait, wait, wait. Okay, good test. So wait, Justine, do you see this? - Yes. - And Brian, do you see? - I don't see that. I don't see that, Marques. - Whoa. - Now wait. So now Brian, do you see this? (Justine gasps) - Now I can see that, Marques. - And then on top of that, spatial audio here is incredibly well developed. So again, you're on the call, the voice of the person to the right comes from the right side. The voice of the person to the left comes from the left. But also, you can just pick up and move the window around, and that angle will match where the people are in the room and where their sound and video comes from. If I put you on the other side of the room, it sounds like they're further away. And if I turn up the environment, and bring them into the moon, or some other 3D space, it actually sounds much more like I'm in a gigantic space with no echo, versus in the actual room. It's all very subtle, but very well considered. So once you're in this a while, you start to notice all these little smaller things. Again, it's not quite human-like. It's not like looking at a video feed of a human face, but it is still, like it has a lot of like, this would be the best avatar anyone's ever made in 2K. Like no one's ever done a 2K face scan and had it look this good, but it's still not as good as a perfect reality. It's a, you've heard the uncanny valley thing before. I think the number one weakness for the avatars or the Personas that I've seen is hair. So basically everyone I've talked to has like a frozen lump of hair instead of flowing realistic hair. And that's true about all flowing things, like however your hair was when you did the scan, it's frozen that way. And so is any necklace you're wearing, whether it's crooked or not, or I guess, technically also any makeup you had on, or however you looked when you did the scan. Maybe that could be a good thing. Maybe you did a scan when you were looking all dolled up, and then you get on a 7:00 AM call, and you still look perfect even though you look like you just woke up in real life. So I guess there's that too. But anyway, all that is to say FaceTime. FaceTime is the most well thought out, like most futuristic Vision Pro experience. It just is. So I'll end this video with this. Now you know what it's like to use and operate the Vision Pro. But there's still a lot more to consider when actually considering if you should buy and own this thing, from the use cases, to the things that work well, and don't work well, the philosophy behind it, the prices, all of that stuff. That's what's gonna be for my full review. Like there are parts of this thing that are absolutely amazing, unparalleled, best I've ever seen. But the reason it's so interesting is because it's actually a young category. Like we're so used to this slow, boring iteration in mature categories, like smartphones, and laptops, and you always see the comments talking about how tech is so boring, but now they're actually jumping into something risky, and it's actually fun, and there is downfalls and flaws, and it's fun to actually weigh the pros and cons. So I'll be expanding on all these way more in the full review, but I'll leave you with this. I've got my upsides and downsides to Vision Pro. It's been a week. Upsides, some of the stuff that's the best I've ever seen in a headset. Immersion, placement in space, eye tracking and hand control, passthrough, ecosystem, and spatial audio. And the downsides, weight and comfort, the eyes on the outside, app selection right now, battery life, and price. So the full reviews in the works. Definitely get subscribed to be among the first to see that when it drops. Either way, till the next one. Thanks for watching. Catch you later. Peace.",1787.28,621.843,433.9740000000001

Marques Brownlee,SaneSRqePVY,VR,Apple,"(bright music) - All right, it's finally here. This is the Apple Vision Pro. This is the beginning of Apple's spatial computing journey. Their first headset, AR, VR, wearable face computer, whatever you want to call it, and this is the unboxing. So everything that I show you guys in this box, it's gonna be a representation of what you would get should you decide to spend the $3,500 that it takes to get one of these, or in this case actually $3,900 because this is the 1TB Vision Pro. You'll see the accessories. You'll see it booted up for the first time. And this is very much the beginning of our Apple Vision Pro investigation and series of videos. So definitely get subscribed to make sure you're among the first to see that when the rest of those come out. So big box, but the headset is relatively small. Shout out to JerryRigEverything for the knife. (tape tearing) And inside. (gentle music) This is a really soft box. Whoa. And this here is a third little box. So this is an incredibly flimsy box, but I'll just take this one out. So the three things we have now are the Vision Pro headset in this box, the Vision Pro Zeiss lenses. So these are optical inserts. So if you have a prescription, then these come in the box and they will magnetically attach to the headsets, so if you wear glasses, you can still use the headset. And this is the optional $200 extra Vision Pro Travel Case. This thing, this is a whole aesthetic. I'll get to that in a second. I'm just gonna leave that right here. But this is the headset itself. It's gonna slide, yep, out of this. (gentle music) So this is like the size of, I mean, it's bigger than a Mac box. This might be bigger than the Mac Studio box, but there you go. And it's got all the pull tabs. I do expect pretty good packaging here. This is such a high pressure first gen product for Apple, so I'm expecting pretty good packaging for this introduction to a first gen thing. Take the tabs off. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) And then it's like a shoebox. Okay, so there's the headset. So the headset comes with this little cover on it, and it's dressed up with one of these bands. This band right here is the one that you see in all the commercials. It's this really soft, stretchy fabric material, and it's in this sort of cardboard head. This is the Solo Knit Band. There's another band though that I'm pretty sure comes with this that is called the Dual Loop Band. So I'm gonna put this to the side real quick and see what else comes in this like shoebox-size box. So this pops off. This is quality. And then we're into the inside, which is a Design by Apple in California pamphlet. Oh, I bet there's stickers in here. Oh, there's a microfiber too. Okay. Then there is the Light Seal Cushion. Oh, I think you get two of these. Yeah, there's one thin Light Seal and one thick Light Seal. I'll get to that in a second. And at the top, there's a lot of explaining to do, some more heavy Vision Pro paperwork. And this is the Dual Loop Band. So this is the second band that goes both around the back of your head and over the top of your head. We'll try that out for comfort over the Solo Knit Band.",0.059,621.843,229.34900000000005
Marques Brownlee,SaneSRqePVY,VR,Apple,"And then there's your power. So the battery that comes with the Vision Pro is this thing right here. It's all very white. Everything in this box is either white or silver. It's pretty heavy. (covering ripping) So this smells pretty new. (chuckles) It's got this white braided cable, and I don't know if Apple's even called this MagSafe, but at the end of this cable is one proprietary connector right there. And that connector is what plugs into the side of the headset. And this is the battery, the two and a half to three hour battery, that comes with Vision Pro. It says on the back actually 3,166 milliamp hours. I know a lot of phones that have 5,000 milliamp hour batteries that feel much lighter than this, so I'm curious why this feels so heavy, but that's the battery. And then in order to get more than two and a half hours, or to charge the battery, you have the cable, USB-C, and the wall brick. So let's see what the wall brick says. I hope it charges fast. 30 watts. So not super fast, but this is a 30-watt brick USB type C, and then a C to C braided cable. Okay, that's it for the inside of this box, so now let's go over these accessories. So, okay, let's do the paperwork first because this is probably the most common stuff. Everyone's gonna get this. This is a little booklet of what's in the box and a sort of a first. And that is all the pairing it to your iPhone, putting it on for the first time, connecting the straps. I'll show you guys this. Oh, and even how to store the cable around the battery. So apparently you do not wanna wrap it vertically, but you do wanna wrap it horizontally with a little bit of slack. Okay, I bet there's stickers. So polishing cloth, and that is a different polishing cloth to the one that comes with their monitors. Oh, it's nice and thin. That's a nice polishing cloth. People were comparing it to the like $20 polishing cloth for the Studio display and the Pro display, this is a different polishing cloth. The front of it is glass. You're probably gonna want to use this to wipe it down once in a while, so I feel like this is a microfiber I'll keep. I know some people unboxing this who are gonna be very disappointed in the lack of Vision Pro themed stickers. All right, so when you buy an Apple Vision Pro, everyone actually has to go through a sort of a face scanning process. So you actually use the iPhone with the Face ID sensors to measure the depth and scan around your eyes and your face, and you end up with a custom-fitted Light Seal. The Light Seal Cushion is either thin or thick. So maybe you have the optical inserts and you want it a little further from your face or you just want a little extra cushion, this would be the thicker cushion that you would use. Okay, so there you go. That's the thicker cushion. But the idea is the Light Seal around Vision Pro is shaped to roughly match your face. It's not like exactly custom molded. It's more that they have a preset number of different sizes and shapes, and when you do the scan, it picks the one that matches you the best to give you the best immersion. Let's take the plastic or the cardboard off of Vision Pro, and, huh, sort of a standard head size, I guess, right there. And if we take this protective off the first time, dang, there's your glass. A lot of lights in this room,",262.02,621.843,212.81199999999998
Marques Brownlee,SaneSRqePVY,VR,Apple,"so it's gonna be pretty reflective, but now you can probably imagine why people are gonna carry this Vision Pro cloth. Notice it says Vision Pro on the microfiber. Hopefully you can see that. But yeah, so when you get the headset, you're gonna notice two things. One, this is the thicker version, this thinner version pops off. And two, this Light Seal. This is the custom Light Seal that pops off, and then you're just left with this. This is the entire computer for Apple Vision Pro. It's pretty small. It's not unlike a lot of other VR headsets, but it's got this aluminum housing around the outside. You can see the tons of sensors and glass, and it is very front weighted. This Light Seal is what's ideally shaped to match your face and block the light out. It attaches just like AirPods Max, you've seen AirPods Max headphone covers just like that. There you go. And I'm gonna go with the thin Light Seal Cushion. And there's the normal look to the Vision Pro headset. Now let's take the Dual Loop Band out because this is the other one that I. There's been a lot of talk about the weight of the Vision Pro, and this is the reason why Apple has decided to include two bands in the box. There are different band sizes as well. So when you measure your head, you're either getting a small, medium, or a large size for your bands. So I've got mediums of both of these. For this Dual Loop, let's take it out so you can see. So much cardboard. There's two loops. One over your head and one behind your head. So there's a very specific process to taking off and attaching these bands with Vision Pro. So I'm gonna put this on for the first time without booting it up just so you can see how this works. So this is the Solo Band right here. Kind of goes around the back of your head. And then if I'm in the right, yep, this spot right here, this, you just crank this and it tightens it up. Yeah, and the weight is really, basically just now pulling it onto the front of your face. All the weight is on the front, and it kind of lands on your cheeks and on your forehead. This is how it looks in all the commercials. It's the most simple looking band. You can pull the band up or down to kind of adjust the way it sits on your head, but as you can probably already tell, that might get a little uncomfortable. So to take this band off and switch to the other one, all you got to do is you see this orange pull tab in here? This orange pull tab is just to release the band from the Vision Pro. So if I pull that, it unclicks the metal, and I pull that other one, and it just pops right off. And that's the headset without the band attached to it. And you have these little pods here over each ear, which are a bunch of speaker drivers pointing down into your ear. These are some seriously small components. They're so dense though, like this is heavy despite being small. So if you wanna put the other band on, it's basically exactly as you'd expect. Attaches like that and like that, and now you can change it with Velcro. You can make it taller in the top, taller in the back. So let's try it. Let's try taller in the top and taller in the back. Well, that's so much more well distributed. And I happen to adjust it pretty close to my head pretty much perfectly. That is gonna be much easier to wear for longer, but of course now you have this thing across the top of your head,",487.11,621.843,217.78400000000005
Marques Brownlee,SaneSRqePVY,VR,Apple,"so not everybody's gonna like that, but I think it's immediately a better fit. It's more comfortable. Wow, okay. I'm probably gonna be using that more often. But let's get to this travel case. So this I guess isn't really a travel case as much as it's just like a protective outer layer for the glass since this whole outside, which has a ton of fingerprints already, is just covered in glass. You might wanna just pop it in here, and then theoretically you can maybe put that in a backpack. I don't know if you would want to, but. (laughs) This is the external extra Vision Pro Travel Case. It's got this handle on the top, but when it extends out a little bit, that's nice. That's well thought. Nice and tight. And then (zippers rasping) it opens up, and it's got sort of molding in the places that you'd put the headset. So this is where the battery will go. And it's even got this molded spot for the cable, so I can slide that in there, Velcro it down, and the cable should be able to just wrap in here. Then the other side, another case? And then it says this is where your, oh, accessory pouch. So this is where you put polishing cloth, power brick, and USB-C charging cable. These things make sense. Keep them in there. Activated carbon deodorizer. Do not eat. Then you put the headset in here, put the accessories in there, and close it up. That's actually pretty solid. I know people were making fun of the price of the $200 Vision Pro accessory case. But the thing is I wouldn't wanna travel with this without the case, and I do think people are gonna wanna travel with this. The number one use case I've been looking forward to with Vision Pro is airplanes, so I'm gonna need a pretty big backpack to have extra room for all of this, but I do think I'm gonna be trying that. Let's boot it up for the first time. Let's get it all set up. So this is what you'll have to do when you get out Vision Pro, ready? Open the case. Get your battery out first. The battery has a special cable on the end. Get your headset out, maybe take off your knit cap or whatever this is called. Pick between your thick or thin Light Seal cover. I'll go thin. Pick between your Dual Loop or your Solo Knit Band. I'll go Solo Knit. And then if you wanna charge it up or plug it straight into the wall, the battery doesn't appear to have a removable cable. I'm sure some Apple Store has some tool to remove this cable whenever they need to replace it, but what it does have is a USB-C port on the side. So if I ever wanna just plug the headset straight into the wall, I'm plugging the battery straight into the wall. But assuming it's charged, the last step here is to go to the left side of the headset. And you see this little proprietary circular thing right here? All I'm gonna do is line up the dot with the bottom and then twist and it'll start to glow just like that, and that means it's starting up for the first time. Takes about a minute to boot up. And then I will go right into the setup process, which I'm sure you'll all wanna see on camera. Ah. (gentle startup music) And I see a checkbox. (Vision Pro bleeping) How do I look? Ridiculous? Do I look great or ridiculous?",721.14,621.843,213.198
Marques Brownlee,SaneSRqePVY,VR,Apple,"Decent? Okay, I can see you guys. So there's a little hello script, and it's booting up for the first time, but I'm gonna save this, all of this setup and all of this using Vision Pro. That's gonna be the next video. So last thing I'm gonna show you is the Zeiss lenses. If you happen to wear glasses or have a prescription, you will be able to use this headset as well with that prescription with a $100 pair of Zeiss lenses. I think it's 100 bucks for readers and 150 for prescription lenses. But either way, they're really quite small and they're magnetic. And since Zeiss runs the world of glass, this is kind of your only option is these things right here. All you got to do though to attach them is to this off. And you grab one of the prescription lenses, and you just (lenses snapping) snap it in place like that. Hope you could see that. (lenses snapping) It's a pretty strong magnet. I do not have a prescription, but what I've been told is then you go ahead and scan this code with the headset so that it knows what your prescription is and adjusts everything accordingly, which I think is pretty well thought out. But I think that's where I have to end it, so stay tuned. Definitely get subscribed for the following videos 'cause you already know I got to set this thing up. I got to show you guys how to use Vision Pro. Show you guys what I've been talking about as far as weight distribution, the games that you can play, the experiences you can have, the movies you can watch, the apps that it has. There's a lot more, so get subscribed to see that. And big shout out to the sponsor of this video, Anker. So if you're even considering getting a Vision Pro, you probably already have an iPhone, in which case it would be good to at least know about Anker's new MagGo lineup. So they've got some charging accessories. This one I think is pretty sweet. This is a three-in-one. So it's called the Wireless Charging Station. It unfolds, it's lightweight and compact, and you can charge three things at once. Your iPhone up on the MagSafe charger, then something like AirPods down here at the Qi charger at the bottom, and flip out an Apple Watch charger. And a 30 minute charge can give your Apple Watch Series 9 almost 50% battery. But this one is actually super convenient to me. This is the MagGo Power Bank. So again, MagSafe, slaps right on the back of the phone, but it's got the screen on it so you can always charge on the go. And there's a built-in battery, and we love good built-in battery, but it's 10,000 milliamp hours, so you can charge your iPhone 15 Pro almost two full times without even plugging into the wall. And there's also a nice little stand, so you can have it in a, what's that feature called, standby mode, whenever you want just by popping it up like that. So I like that too. So both of these things can charge your devices at up to 15 watts wirelessly. And they're good with Qi2 as well, so they can charge your non iPhones if you want that. So I think it's worth it. Check it out. Link in the description. And shout out to Anker again for sponsoring this portion of the video. So that's been it. Thanks again for watching, and I'm gonna go set up my Vision Pro now. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (quirky electronic music)",957.24,621.843,178.84799999999998
Marques Brownlee,tciqW8VKfOU,VR,Apple,okay I don't know how many of you all noticed this or what it actually means but note that the first time Apple ever showed the Vision Pro headset to the world in real life they used this shot,0.0,621.843,21.660000000000004
Marques Brownlee,tciqW8VKfOU,VR,Apple,this sort of stabilized orbiting short shot rotating around ahead and then looking through the headset inside and I started seeing it bubbling up on Twitter but you might have caught that it's,10.26,621.843,17.1
Marques Brownlee,tciqW8VKfOU,VR,Apple,actually a reference to this shot in Ready Player One he gave us a place to go a place called The Oasis,18.72,621.843,21.979
Marques Brownlee,tciqW8VKfOU,VR,Apple,it's basically the exact same shot what is it supposed to mean that they're referencing that movie like ready player one is actually a pretty dystopian movie where right after that scene they,29.3,621.843,19.181
Marques Brownlee,tciqW8VKfOU,VR,Apple,explain how people got way too into the virtual world to the point where they were literally neglecting their kids and correlating it too much with real life so maybe it's a warning maybe it's a coincidence it's probably not a coincidence,39.42,621.843,27.340000000000003
Marques Brownlee,OFvXuyITwBI,VR,Apple,foreign Pro I had about a 30 minute demo just using this new headset I had about a trillion questions so I tried to ask as many of them as I possibly could of Apple to get all the answers I could for you and for myself so without any further Ado let's just jump right in this is everything you need to know so far about Apple's new AR VR headset so the first question naturally what is it so first things first this is a first generation device from Apple which we don't see very often but it is an augmented reality slash virtual reality headset with a bunch of cameras and sensors inside that you strap to your face it'll start at three thousand five hundred dollars and it'll go on sale starting sometime early next year nobody's been able to shoot video of using it yet so I'm gonna have to do my best with descriptions here but fundamentally this isn't something that's paired to your iPhone or your Mac by default it's a standalone computer with an M2 Chip inside its own Wi-Fi connection a roughly 4K micro OLED display for each eye a set of speakers right above each ear on the band and then a dedicated new R1 chip which is doing all of the real-time processing from all the sensors that make this headset pretty special but we'll get to that in a second so all right then how does it work well basically we've seen VR headsets and AR headsets before it's uh typically there's screens on the inside and then on the outside there's some sort of shell which has some sensors on the outside that help detect what is in your room around you and help to see the controllers in your hands but with this one there are no controllers at all they're not making any for it there aren't going to be any optional accessory they're not even going to design any controllers you are controlling this thing entirely with your hands and your eyes and your voice so you put this headset on and basically all over the headset there are an absolute ton of sensors you have two main forward-facing cameras two down downward facing cameras two more cameras for the sides two infrared illuminators a lidar scanner a true depth camera these are all to keep track of what's happening around the headset and also to track your hands in front of your face and then on the inside there's also a bunch of infrared illuminators and infrared cameras that are purely there just there to track your eyes so there's actually a setup process before you even get the headset you basically measure you sort of scan your face with the true depth camera on the iPhone and it uses that depth information about your face to give you sort of a custom cut out this will be a process that you can do in Apple Stores but basically you get the headset with the custom cut out for your face if you have glasses there are some Zeiss lenses but you finally get the headset out and you put it on and there's some nice meshing on the back some fabric that stretches and is pretty breathable it's built extremely well with all this metal and glass and then once you get it going the most impressive thing about this headset the most impressive thing is the eye tracking I'm not even kidding this this eye tracking is sick so basically the eye tracking in this headset as it looks at your eyes and keeps track of where your eyes move around is the closest thing that I've experienced to like magic like I don't I normally don't call Tech things sort of magical or surreal like this but this was even for a pre-release product kind of unbelievable how well it does anytime you move your eyes around the UI it would immediately highlight and select exactly what you're looking at no matter how small the target was or what you're looking at and then when you want to select something all you do is take your fingers like this and just touch them together that's how you click so you look at something click look at something click so there's actually there's a calibration process when you first set up the headset you put it on for the first time where you basically just look around with your eyes at a bunch of different dots so it learns your eyes and then yeah from that point on you're just cruising you're sailing through everything by just looking at things and it feels like telepathic you just look at something and select it and,2.1,621.843,475.44000000000005
Marques Brownlee,OFvXuyITwBI,VR,Apple,that's it so this is how the whole UI works pretty much every other headset has the ability to use your hands to select things but most of them rely on the sensors on the outside to keep track of a set of controllers for maximum accuracy but this massive array of sensors on the outside of Apple's headset have done an impressively good job of picking up what my hand is doing kind of no matter where it is so like I said there's sensors all the way around the thing they're facing forward but they're facing sideways and facing down so I can just kind of rest my hand like wherever and look at stuff and click I don't even have to move my head I can just look at something and just click my fingers I kind of did it by accident a few times like I just sort of be sitting there and my fingertips would actually touch and I'd select whatever I was looking at but pretty quickly you get used to just just this just just doing this now there are also some text boxes occasionally you want to type something and so you can look at the text box select it and then a keyboard will pop up and you can look at the letters but also you can just look at a search box field and just start talking and it'll start filling in whatever you're saying because there's microphones on the headset and there's also something they're calling optic ID which is basically kind of just the fingerprint ID of the headset because it's looking at your eyes and everyone's eyes is a different unique biometric pattern and so you log in just by putting a headset on and it looks at your eyes so optic ID this thing knows your eyes really well so you've probably seen all these weird looking frames where you can see people's eyes through it like this this super weird thing that I've never seen in any other headset so what is happening here well spoiler alert it's not actually transparent it kind of looks like it's a glass transparent thing but it's not it appears to be because there's actually an OLED screen facing out this is what I would call a 2 way pass-through that's what I'm calling it see a normal VR headset we've seen is of course completely opaque usually it's like black plastic or something like that so in order to see through to your actual environment without taking the headset off like for picking up your controllers or walking around a room without hitting a wall they have a pass-through mode so it'll turn on a camera on the outside so you can see what's going on around you and some pass-through modes are better than others some will do it from a single black and white camera some will do stereo pass through from two cameras some will do color pass through the pass-through on Apple's headset is again the best I've ever seen in a headset it's stereo it's color it's sharp it's real time it's really good so then the eyes you see from the outside are actually an OLED display showing what your eyes look like to the cameras inside the headset so it shows your eyes like this whenever you're using any sort of pass-through mode and if you can see your environment it'll show your eyes so you're not actually like looking at someone's eyes but it kind of feels like you are kind of creepy a little bit I don't know it's the simplest way of explaining it if they're doing something fully immersive in VR like watching a movie or playing a game then it won't show their eyes it'll show this graphic over their eyes instead it's a really interesting look it's a it's a bold look I just have this like thought of like you're uh you're on a airplane and the flight attendant walks up and Taps you hey do you want any water and you just look up and your eyes shine through the headset it's just a weird thing I don't think it's smart but I don't think other headsets are gonna do it because most of them don't have it in the budget to have a screen facing the outside but then let's get to the burning question you've probably already been thinking what does it actually do so okay I'm sort of I'm separating this into three bulk categories that I made up and I'm kind of proud of here which are Computing content and connections now actually I should preface this all by saying this is a first gen product so right now the only apps that show up on the home screen are Apple's apps just like when the first iPhone came out with no app store it's just Apple's apps but the,244.44,621.843,464.5800000000001
Marques Brownlee,OFvXuyITwBI,VR,Apple,reason this is coming out or at least getting announced so early but it's not coming out till next year is to give this window for developers to start developing their own apps and making cool things for this headset to do that are way more interesting and way more functional but it does have a core set of functions so for computing I think this is the one that's probably the least likely to be used by most normal people but it is a pretty direct shot at what meta just did with the quest Pro the 1500 Quest Pro so you can use this thing as its own computer with web browsing Etc with these 4K windows in front of you that you can move around and do all kinds of stuff with your hands now this will be its own OS again it's not running off your phone or anything it's running a whole new operating system called Vision OS and it seems pretty similar pretty similar to iPad OS just in the fact that you know you're just touching things in iPad OS and in this headset you look at something and then you touch your fingers together and that's basically just like a normal touch but I was really impressed with the responsiveness again this was better than any headset I've seen with just your hands if I wanted to scroll through something like a safari window I literally in air would touch my fingers together and drag the window and it would scroll nearly in real time I would like throw it around like toss it catch it toss it the other way and start scrolling through things with my finger resizing Windows dragging the corners of things and I was super impressed with that too now if you're like me you might have also had some questions about the sharpness like do I really want to wear something like this for a long time to work like it's on a computer and I think I was also pretty smartly addressed they use a selective rendering based on the super good eye tracking so the computing power is basically focusing on sharply rendering the part of the screen that you're actually looking at while saving power on the rest it's pretty cool and it works so quickly that I did not notice it while using it and then the part you're looking at is actually very sharp like I said before they're super high resolution screens they're 4K I don't know if I have a number for refresh rate but it felt like 120 hertz and you know I fatigue will eventually become a thing with any headset you strapped to your face but this would be on the lower level of eye fatigue compared to what I've experienced with some others and then for even more heavy work this was kind of nuts but they showed it in the keynote apparently if you have a Mac and you want to do Mac OS stuff you can just with the headset on just look at your Mac and it will pick up what you're doing and it'll mirror the max display as one of the 4K windows for you in the headset and then you can even connect a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth trackpad and start working around like it's an actual Mac just with a bigger screen wherever you want at yeah ecosystem stuff so that's Computing I definitely got to try it but then of course there's the uh the connection stuff you got messaging you can type out messages to people just like as if you were on a Mac but there's also impressively FaceTime now I don't even know that this is necessarily better than a normal FaceTime holding your phone or like on a laptop other than the fact that I guess you don't have to be holding anything but you can have people's windows floating in front of you as you talk to them on FaceTime but you might also be asking wait a second if I'm not holding my phone in front of me what do other people on FaceTime see well the answer is they'll see a 3D rendered model of you that was scanned into the system from your iPhone that syncs up and matches the movements of your face with eye tracking and all the other sensors of the headset so I I got to try it it is it works okay so it's it's it's not as good as obviously looking at a person I just feel like a FaceTime you're trying to have like a personal connection with the person and this is obviously more personal than an avatar or like a cartoon of you but it's just it feels kind of somewhere in between it's kind of like a Google project Starline which I just did that video about a couple weeks ago if you haven't already seen,476.94,621.843,458.3990000000001
Marques Brownlee,OFvXuyITwBI,VR,Apple,that I'll leave a link with a like button so you can check it out but it feels sort of in that like uncanny valley you know moving 3D model territory instead of looking at an actual person it's kind of how I picture it but then last but not least of course content people are just going to watch content on this thing and I think this is the industry now that Apple's jumping into it that is poised to explode like we've had VR games and VR videos for a long time and apple is now also able to do this they of course put their own spin on it and they can use the power and the draw of the Apple brand to get content creators and big motion picture studios and sports leagues and all kinds of creatives to work to make content that looks really good specifically on Apple's headset and in Apple's formats I can personally save from My Demo hell yes I would watch I would pay to watch an NBA game Courtside in the VR headset the quality is good enough and obviously it's not going to be as immersive as feeling the energy from the crowd but you're not paying Courtside prices you'd probably pay is a total guess 10 20 bucks to watch an NBA game Courtside or have some subscription to do that I would totally do that and it would be fun but even with regular 2D content like movies just watching a regular movie you can totally just sit back put the headset on maybe even put some headphones on and just like on a plane seat just watch a movie as if you're in a theater for one which is pretty sweet there is that digital crown on the side that actually lets you spin it clockwise to move in more immersion and fully envelop you in the VR environment or you can turn it counterclockwise to bring in more of your real world environment with pass-through in your peripheral vision kind of a neat trick and then there's also this kind of weird feature where you can take 3D photos and videos with the cameras built into the headset itself and I did not like this one so there was a demo of like a a recording from a headset camera of a kid blowing out some candles on a birthday cake basically and I got to watch this actual scene in the actual Apple headset so because there's two cameras like front-facing there they can record stereoscopic 3D so you can turn on the recording and in that moment sit down and record a super immersive video and then when you watch it back in the headset it's like you're reliving this moment in 3D which can feel kind of cool but I just I can't get the image of like the dad at the birthday party with the headset on just recording things like walking around it just doesn't it's what kind of memory is that for the other people around you you know like I saw this and I immediately thought back to the the reasons we all know why Google Glass failed which is it was ahead of its time but it's also like they're walking around with a camera on your face and everybody knows that you have a camera on your face it just wasn't cool dad what are you doing why do you why are your eyes sticking out through the headset so all right the number one question I've gotten after I've actually tried this thing is is it any good is this headset any good and the answer is well yes some of the parts of this headset that I tried are actually the best I have ever seen in any VR headset by a mile specifically the eye tracking and the Hand tracking now of course it's going to be up to developers to really make it good but I think the foundational like how do you use it part is pretty amazing but that doesn't mean there aren't any downsides all right number one there was no haptics of course because you don't have controllers you're just doing everything with your hands in the air there's no way to have any sort of haptic feedback there was a demo that I did where like I stuck my hand out a wall on the other side of the room opened up and a dinosaur was back there and a butterfly flew out I held out my hand and the butterfly flew up and landed on my finger it could track and see all that information in the volumetric all the computation to make that happen was amazing but when the butterfly landed and I didn't feel anything there was that moment of like oh right this is a VR headset but then number two this was interesting this is pretty heavy this is a pretty heavy VR headset kind of the,706.079,621.843,498.902
Marques Brownlee,OFvXuyITwBI,VR,Apple,same way that um airpods max the Apple's metal headphones are heavier than most plastic headphones there's a reason why most other VR headsets are just plastic it's not because that's cheap it's because it's lightweight it's fatiguing to have a heavy thing on your head and this is a headset made of metal and glass it's heavy now it is also super well built like there is no arguing that but I do wonder about using it for longer than the half hour that I did I wonder if it would be more fatiguing to my head that's also actually why the battery isn't attached to it that would be a ton of weight to carry on your head so they connected the battery instead through a proprietary cable and that actually can sit next to you on the couch or in your back pocket and that brings us to the other thing the battery life two hours two hour battery life on the headset which is not that great it's not that long now there's a USBC port on the battery bank and you can plug that into the wall for infinite time but the second you unplug from the wall yeah two hours from that pretty hefty battery bank which is like okay maybe most people won't be spending a lot of time in the headset but you did also just show us apple and AD of people like watching a movie in the headset that's already like most movies are two hours plus so something we're thinking about there's just a two hour but I'm sure people will make bigger external batteries for this thing but two hours and then also I couldn't get a firm answer here on if there are fans inside or not but I think they're stands like they're certainly vents for fans anyway and if you're gaming for long enough or using it for long enough do those spin up do they ever get loud do they ever kill your battery that's kind of unclear but then of course the main thing that everybody's talking about it's expensive it's 3 500 so is that pricey yeah that's very expensive but this is the thing that is always weird with Apple products like there is no direct comp like I always you always say it's expensive but like compared to what and they they did this with uh the pro display xdr they've done this with even airpods Max a little bit but like there there are several things that this headset does that no other headset does the eye tracking the hand tracking that's super good even if an equivalent headset came along today and did all of the same stuff that this does hardware and software wise it still wouldn't have face time it still wouldn't have like looking at a Mac and then the ecosystem allowing the max display to pop up so this is kind of something that only Apple could pull off so bottom line you know I got to try it I thought it was extremely impressive but at the end of the day this is not a product for the masses I mean obviously right it's three thousand five hundred dollars it has the word Pro in the name too but this this feels like this series zero like the Apple Watch Remember When the Apple watch first came out the series zero where it's really going to be up to the first gen the early adopters and the developers to decide the direction that this thing goes to decide what people actually want to use it for and that'll shape the future versions of it that we may eventually get down the road then maybe someday there's like a a vision SE that's like 400 bucks that the masses will all adopt and it'll be this next Generation hit product Maybe but as of right now this is very much in the sort of early adopter people like me people like watching this video testing phase to figure it out so that's the Apple Vision Pro it's uh it's it's the rich person's toy and the developers Muse for right now but we'll see how far this thing goes in the near future it's coming out next year it's not that far off it's not that far away it's really interesting times either way this was also part of a huge entire WWDC keynote so if you want to watch my recap of the rest of that stuff ideally get subscribed because there's going to be a video recap of the biggest announcements of which there are many other things and also uh I'll shout out the waveform podcast to get subscribed there too because the next episode I'll just say it it's a banger it's pretty sick so hit sub hit like hang out in the comments that's been it for this one thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,955.68,621.843,504.1599999999999

Unbox Therapy,pE0-TeChSy0,VR,Apple,"oh well listen when you see the Yellow Tape you know you're going to have an interesting package at least on this channel inside this box is something unexpected but also expected I just didn't expect to see it as soon as it arrived here so let's go ahead and unbox this and see what we're dealing with today's episode is brought to you by Paris ran and their new affordable 4K projector you can pick this thing up for under 500 bucks with the code that's going to be down in the description of this video you're getting 4K UHD resolution up to 200 in projected you've also got 24 WS of audio power via a dual speaker setup 600 lumens of brightness and 40,000 hours of lamp life so not only do you have Android TV you've also got autofocus built in so you just basically point this thing at the wall and it does the rest Wi-Fi 6 is built in Bluetooth 5 and a bunch of connectivity via HDMI 21 usba USBC and even ethernet land so if you've been been holding off looking at a 4K projector so you can have movie night and blow the screen up big this might get you interested because that price point is much lower than it normally is coming in with today's code in the description at under 500 bucks I personally haven't seen a 4K capable projector with Android TV at that price previously so there you have it that is the Paris rone 4K UHD projector on a special promotion right now for unbox therapy viewers so if you guys are curious definitely go check out the details down in the description will asked me he's like hey you want to check this thing out and I was like absolutely because it is probably no it's definitely our closest exposure yet to something you can buy that resembles the Apple Vision Pro and believe it or not this is currently being sold in China I don't know what the price is in China I just know it's expensive to get it sent over here now obviously it is",0.16,621.843,248.3209999999999
Unbox Therapy,pE0-TeChSy0,VR,Apple,not official obviously this has nothing to do with apple other than Apple being the inspiration for a copycat style of product but it is amazing how quickly these parties can work to create these replicas when it comes to high-profile products and specifically Apple products now this this is a working product as well this is not like just a mockup the shape and Design This is a product that actually works as a headset mimicking everything about Apple's eventual Vision Pro you can see some interesting stickers a QR code I think we can remove those now see this material here it's made to look like it's fabric but it's not it has the texture of fabric it is not Fabric and probably what happened here is there was like an existing headset and as soon as Apple's event finished they were like okay we need to create a design and then Jam our existing components into it so that it is as comparable to a Vision Pro so we can charge as much money as possible for it inside we have some little protectors on each of the lenses some volume controls probably some speakers and mics a USBC connector on this side this is our headband which looks like a sort of typical VR headset headband it's not the fancy Apple headband that you saw in their event although these points do pivot slightly we've got some other dedicated controls which are familiar for anyone who has used any android-based headset so menu selector and back there's a snapshot button on the top for photos now when you look at the front it's a bit of a dead giveaway that this is certainly not a Vision Pro because you've got these two prominent cameras where on the Vision Pro you would not see these they have supplied a user guide and a couple more components including a USB cable a USB power brick and I believe here is your controller now this is wired exclusively by the looks of it so this is going to plug in into the side of,125.719,621.843,285.721

CNET,Gyo6apLIMM4,VR,Apple,"I've covered a lot of different types of tech but I really been covering VR and AR for a very long time I reviewed Google Glass when it came out I looked at the very first Oculus demos um and followed that all the way through to the release of the rift and looked at pretty much everything I'm you know there was gear VR doing reviews of that Google Daydream um you know one-off things like lenovo's Mirage solo if you remember that um there's magic leap where I went to Magic leap's headquarters before the release of magic Le and uh and tried it out uh Hollin 2 where I went to Microsoft's headquarters and looked at that on release and um going to meta reality research labs in 2022 where I got to look at some of the technology that's that's in in a way in The Vision Pro some of the realistic avatars that they had and even things like neural input technology which I'll talk about in a bit maybe over this time but but anyway I'm saying that as a big onramp to Vision Pro because when when I looked at Vision Pro I was kind of thinking of it in terms of all the other headsets that I'd seen before and a lot of amazing moments and a lot of weird moments and things that are almost there and I've seen mixed reality too on things like um vario headsets they're they're finished startup so what apples did felt like the synthesis of a lot of things I've seen but a lot of people out there have not tried these headsets and so what I was trying to do was simultaneously explain it for all the time I've been doing it but also think about it in terms of you maybe not having followed this and going what is this about and what it really is Apple's calling it a spatial computer and in some ways you okay why isn't it a VR headset and it really it is a VR headset uh conceptually you know this is uh closed off um I can see you but using cameras that pass through high resolution views of that if the lights were dim enough you could see these weird Lowes eyes that blink and move that are scans of of my eyes but that's to create an illusion that I'm looking through this really it's a closed off headset and it's doing stuff that VR does which is to show you things as you move around and immerse you but a lot of VR headsets are doing mixed reality which is to blend things with the outside and the end you know camera feed of the real world and blending Apple does that but they do it at a really high fidelity something that I really have not seen in I've not seen in a self-contained headset before um the 4K micro OLED displays on here are stunning I'm looking at them right now and they look Ultra crisp and they particularly pop for things like films and so that's amazing in terms of an audio visual experience but then also Apple's touting it as a computer and the computer part it hooks in iOS so it's an iOS you know multi- window thing and that's very different there have been no other headsets out there that have done that hooked into all the stuff that you probably already use Windows users who use VR might be like Scott come on I can do this on Windows and you can but that also requires a PC and a lot of the functionality on that is not intuitively designed to always be for that you have to have like steam VR or another in between so Apple's doing this all selfcontain working with iCloud kind of feel like an iPad on your face and then like where does that go from here the eye and hand tracking that I have with this is really amazing in that when I look around anything I pinpoint with my eyes and then I can pinch which I just open photos or I can swipe or I can expand I just expanded my photo wherever I'm looking I can expand like it's reading my mind that feels like some futuristic air mouse and is a lot more intuitive than meta's hand tracking where they already have hand tracking on the quest but it's a little more unreliable in my experience but it's getting better the one thing Apple that I haven't seen is how this works is an everyday do everything computer find the hand tracking sometimes a little unreliable and then when working with a keyboard or mouse or a Macbook you can definitely throw your display up and work but I also find that that flow gets a little weird at times and sometimes an app won't quite work the way I want it to so that's that needs to work reliably for me to be a computer but it is a computer it's just that you know it's got an M2 Chip in it so that's my kind of big thought and I've only been using this headset for a week and a couple of days which is more than the average person who's only picking it up today maybe because a lot of people won't buy this and I'm trying to help them understand that on the journey and and I'm going to be trying this out a lot more because I'm sure apple is going to be updating and finessing a lot of this stuff over the course of the next year and years that's like a long summary but but that's basically where I'm at with Vision Pro and I definitely want to hear I can go in a million directions with this so I am happy to take questions and then we can just kind of branch and talk about different paths that that you might want to know killer future it's a good question without a doubt the first time I tried that and I could take it off and talk to you too so you know as I wear this let me let me say hi to you hello um so Apple first made a big deal about Cinema on this when I first tried it out WWDC the thing I said in my review was that the headset that I want to see uh 3D avatar in that is the killer future is that uh I've seen movies in VR headsets in cinema mode going all the way back and it's fun it's immersive but you're trading off visual quality a lot of the time this the visual quality was Superior to my home television which is not OLED and you know it looks stunning and so it felt like I had a personal Cinema on my face I would like to watch movies like that I don't know if I'll fatigue from watching them so that's like a killer app but that's not you know for $3,500 that's not going to be a price that people are going to want to pay for a personal Cinema but I do think that's the most killer feature on it I think the other things in descending order things like the um this not an an app but the ey in hand tracking is fascinating but what do you do with it so spatial photos and video which is Apple's other big feature that they're touting you know they're 3D videos that you can shoot on your iPhone or shoot on the headset they're really compelling and I keep wondering as I'm using it is it the quality of the display or is it the size and immersiveness because I also a colleague Bridget Carey looked at some of hers and I was interested in hearing her reactions and you can look at the playback of of my capture on the CNet review and it looks like it's being very windowed out and you're like okay whatever but the scale of it in headset looks life siize and so it kind of feels like I'm sitting across from my mom and it feels like I'm almost in that world and I kind of want the rest of it to bleed away Apple has an immersive video format that's like almost like vr10 if you've looked at that technology all the way out to here and and the spatial video is out to here eventually if they get out to here I feel like you're going to be using this to like tell a presence into things so I think that's also a killer app but I'm surprised that there aren't more killer apps for this um that really do the immersive things you'd find on like a VR headset but it's interesting I I yeah hello yeah absolutely it's a really good question so Apple has not confirmed the actual field of view for this which is also probably telling because if it was better than other VR headsets Apple would probably be sharing that spec so I it it seems smaller than than the headsets I've used before um I I think it definitely is smaller um you know the field of view on a lot of VR headsets I've used seems to be in around the 110 degree range so i'llbe this in terms of my hands it kind of looks like I'm looking at it like this a little bit and um it definitely is a bit of a a scuba mask you know and especially when you first boot on you might be like wow the field of view is smaller but what's interesting is that as I use it the the intensity of the display the crispness of it and the rest of the fluidity of the of the interface really does make that bleed away and so I don't really notice it that much that being said I wish it was larger um so that's definitely one of the trade-offs on this headset and some people have pointed out when I shot videos The lenses are smaller than on the quest 3 so it's a different type of lens design I don't know if that also May factor into it so um yeah hope that answers your question yeah sure yeah so the question is how much battery life does this actually have with this considerable battery that's here this is one of the things that is very different about Vision Pro than any other Standalone headset I mean you know once the you plug into excuse me just burped but um once you plug into uh you know like PlayStation VR2 you're you're you're cabling it all the time you know PC VR headset it's not doesn't have power other ones have the battery built into the front or the back Apple decided to make this whole standalone thing and this there have been a lot of discussions about this online in terms of U milliamps versus like wat hour just in terms of the power of this battery what does it actually equate to it it's pretty beefy is what I think it is in terms of the throughput they have the special cable here which you know some people online and Ray Wong had in inverse had uh popped this out it looks like a lightning cable but it's thicker than a lightning cable it's it so it suggests to me that it's like very very particular power needs and the battery life has been about two hours is uh you know in terms of I'm still waiting to run run it down completely because I often get nervous around 30% and plug it in because I'm using it for something but I'm GNA start doing some actual battery full battery drain tests some people have said they've gone through a whole movie you know that it could get up to three hours on video playback I've actually found that when I've been using it for about half an hour um it didn't drain as much as I thought it would you know it could might still be about like 70% but um but that you know it's it's not as quickly draining as I thought but it definitely requires you to be near a charger and two and a half hours three hours is still G to be the thing that you're you know you're not going to go out for the day with this and and not bring away to charge it up this battery is a thing and this battery is heavy it's 0 75 pounds it feels definitely heavier than an iPhone and you could stick it in your pocket but you'd feel it and I guess they Belin sells like a strap carrier for it it's fine if you're walking around the room but I I feel like as I've been using Vision Pro I want to sit down and Apple's demos have all been sitting down it's not surprising it's very much a sit and browse type of thing if you've been using VR for a while you might be really annoyed by that and go are you kidding me I walk around in the quest you know it it's all standing and activity and fitness that's what it is right now I think apple right now is I think you can stand and use this but I think with this battery you're going to want to sit down and You're Gonna Want to sort of work on a computer or sit on the sofa it it just seems like that type of device great question and this is one of the weird things that I saw coming for a while with Vision Pro no you cannot wear your glasses with Vision Pro and I'm really frustrated that a lot of VR headsets have been doing this over the years vivex are Elite HTC's headset last year didn't work with glasses and neither did their mobile VR headset and some AR glasses for a while have asked to do prescription inserts and it's like a lot of times they wouldn't fit my prescription in the past I'm over minus8 and they would uh often say oh we don't have your prescription and I would say I know know seems like prescription lens wears have gotten over that hump for me where I can now get them for the quest 3 and uh meta glasses and and for these",0.08,621.843,1450.0040000000004
CNET,Gyo6apLIMM4,VR,Apple,but you cannot wear glasses with these instead you have to get prescription inserts which I have in here from uh from Zeiss and they run about 99 or1 to $150 and they just magnetically pop in which it's nice that they just pop in um and they just snap on and that's it but then you have to get those and then if you're going to share it with anybody and they have glasses they're going to have to get lenses too or wear contacts you could wear contacts with these but this is one of those compromises or decisions that Apple made that it's not going to fit people with glasses and I think it also means that the lenses get closer to your eyes to be for the design of this headset but you know Quest has spacers to fit glasses the um meta Quest press which I brought along with me uh that can fit glasses narrowly and fit them so yeah it's just part of the package on this early product yeah so how are the speakers on these are they good do they give good base what do they sound like how do they work good question and um they're really good they're really good speakers but they're not isolating you know they they are open design so if you're sitting next to somebody you can hear what they're playing I mean it's kind of like if you've been automatic Quest and you can hear a little bit of it and if you're playing something really loud yeah like I was watching a movie next to my son and he was like can you turn down whatever you're playing like it definitely felt like I was doing something next to him that's what airpods are for Apple would say and so you could pop those in it's interesting I popped in airpod Pro 2 uh buds the USBC which is the lossless um one that Apple recommends for better audio and this has a little less lag so I found the sound was pretty equivalent between the airpod Pro 2 and the built-in buds in fact I liked the built-in uh speakers here a little more I felt like they had a little more I don't know um for volume or uh David Carno he's the headphone reviewer will kill me for not using proper terminology here but I feel like I feel like they felt a little more room filling in my head for the feeling of being in a cinema uh they're Punchy the one thing is that I didn't feel like they went quite as loud as I wanted and I've been I've been going to the settings and wondering if I put volume limiting on or whether I'm just I've been ruining my ears and I just feel I mean not that it doesn't get loud it's just that when I'm sitting in cinema mode I want it to get like thunderous L loud and I didn't feel like it was getting there but it's still loud um but it sounded really good and much I mean it is much better than the quest the quest has re fine speakers they're not fantastic but they're but they're good um this between the video and the audio again they're boasting Dolby Atmos support for this like this this really feels like it matches the Fidelity of the display that um that you're getting like a really good sound experience oh yeah triple live yeah we across the board okay fire away I can also just start showing you parts to it too which is which would be good yeah I think it's five I think it's 5T um it's short in that it will not stretch across a room and it's not even designed for that this is like and it has fallen off a table a couple of times so if you if you get up and you have not grabbed the battery the battery's going to fall and I I've been like oh crap let me grab that so it's it's definitely something you have to remember to bring with you and it's another reminder maybe why Apple doesn't have Fitness with this why they're they're not really into you getting up and walking too much uh you could tether this battery then to uh a power thing and then you know have that long cable but you're basically going to keep this near you is is the answer and then nobody asked me this but how it connects is super weird and interesting it has a totally proprietary cable that locks on this is not a power connector that Apple has ever made it looks like a little metal ring with little kind of metal lock dots inside and you put it in to get that you have to put it at at a um 45° angle upwards and then lock it down and so that may seem really annoying but it made sense in that they don't want this cable coming out because this is the only source of power if that like a USBC thing if somebody pulled that out it wouldn't ruin the headset but you just lose everything that you were doing it would just there's no battery here would just go out so this is designed to stay in no matter what that being said you know what happens if someone Yanks this um I don't want to know I don't want to know what happens it don't don't do that um because this is not coming out of the headset it's not mag safe um unless there's a breakaway that I don't know about so actually you just heard it chime up when you that's also the power there's no power button on this headset if you put this cable on and attach it it Powers up the headset and when you want to power it down you just detach the cable which feels like you're doing something wrong I thought like oh do I have to shut it down first there is no shutting down so it's kind of interesting there though there is a secret shutdown that I discovered um the other day because somebody asked me uh what happens if you press and hold the two buttons on top and much like an iPhone if you press and hold them for a little while it will bring up an emergency shutdown I think that's like your phone where if everything is failing and something is just not working you could do that um but I can also get into some of the button features in a moment and this cable does not come out of the battery that's that's like unless you SIM card pin it out that's that's a bonded thing you would have to hold it or Belin sells a battery holder for $50 you know that like goes around your you know like a strap that goes around you you can wear it so yeah that's weird and um and it goes back to maybe you don't walk around you just keep this you know you keep this next to you keep it on your desk um it's not a big walk around type of thing although you could walk it's I I think it's meant to kind of stay relatively in one place yeah right so so what operating system is the V is the U Vision Pro running and do you need another Apple device to set it up so the operating system is called Vision OS but it's very iPad OS based it basically it doesn't look like iPad OS it looks kind of like a combination of Apple watch iPad and a little bit of Mac but it runs a lot of iPad apps in a compatibility mode when you open it it brings up this grid of apps that's almost like the Apple watch and you cannot configure the grid of apps a lot of people are getting annoyed about that that it's alphabetic order and Apple's apps are at the front I I feel like they'll change that at some at some point but we're like a day one I mean it is annoying but you could also search for apps with Siri and kind of is what it is but organizing apps might be frustrating and then you just swipe through and get this grid of you know grid page grid after page grid of apps when you open up an app they open up in these floating um iPad well they're almost more like mac Windows because they're big and you can resize them at the corners by whenever you look at anything it activates so if you look at a corner a corner appears like a like a white icon and you kind of grab you pinch it and you drag it and if you want to close a window there's an X at the bottom that appears only when you're looking at it or there's a bar that you can grab and move Mo the window around and you know iPads have limited multitasking this has unlimited as far as I can tell like you can open up I have not I have not hit a limit on the number of apps that I can have open at once you know i' I've tried like 12 I should probably try more like I've just just go you open up up and they're kind of all overlapping each other that's incredible and also could be like a little bit surprising and cluttery you can also open 3D apps and leave those in addition to the 2D apps which is something that VR headsets don't do so a lot of the apps right now which are pretty simple puzzle in other games like what or what the golf you could open up that have it floating here or a chessboard and also bring up 2D apps and multitask there are some apps that will launch that are only in that experience you know that go into almost like a VR mode but multitasking is definitely part of it there's a control center on top that only appears when you look at it like a little fairy that you have to invoke when you look up and a DOT appears and you click it's totally weird and that brings up a lot of control center commands there's setting but they're not everything it has AirPlay um it has airdrop it doesn't have all the in-depth settings that you might expect and it works with some accessories but not all it works with the magic uh trackpad and keyboard it does not work with a mouse yet and but but I'd and then that's what the OS is and then there's the extra part that you can mirror a Mac into it which allows you to float a Mac monitor from a nearby Mac um but that's not the same it's not like um you won't be able to grab things in that monitor with your fingers that'll only be controlled with keyboard and trackpad and then you can float other apps all around it and that's my best way of describing Vision OS you know it's it's just like a a lot of floating iOS apps and experiences uh in this headset the other question you had was about something what were you talking about yes other Apple devices so I set it up with the iPhone I I think you can just set it up with an Apple ID though you don't need an iPhone but it makes it very easy um if you ever set up an Apple product and they say bring the other Apple product to this product and it will recognize it you scan it and ports over your stuff that's what I did so it just made it very simple the app the iPhone automatically knew I was setting up a Vision Pro it just said Vision Pro detected do you want to do you want to sync um but again some people may not have anything like that they may just set it up with their own Apple ID it really does feel like setting up an iPad or a Mac in that regard it goes through a lot of standard um setups and and and things like that um so I hope that helps so it's kind of again kind of like the the iPad it could do both uh there there's storage on the device and there's a files app just like uh iOS and and Mac so you can save locally um to 256 gigabytes of storage on this model on the on the 34.99 model this is sorry this model is the one terabyte but there's a 34.99 model there's the 36.99 512 gigabyte then there's the one terab to store things but then there's also iCloud and iCloud has storage tiers so it's it's basically the same as any other Apple device and that it uses the iCloud storage um you could also do other cloud storage I guess as well um you know there's Microsoft and other things Google does not have its apps available on Vision Pro yet you'd have to go through the browser but um but yeah it's fully what's really cool is it's fully hooked in for all those things um so it's very flexible in terms of how you want to share things um and download them or upload them awesome um and then so Scott just to also for anyone just joining us we are live on Tik Tok yoube and Instagram all at the same time so thank you so much for joining us I am Tara Fielding the questions to Scott uh that you have um about the Apple Vision Pro given it's also Apple Vision Pro launch day so um another question that we have been getting a lot uh ready Scott so adult enter entainment on the Apple Vision Pro if you could um like confirm deny give people you know what you know your expert expertise on the Apple Vision Pro and that topic so let's talk about adult entertainment children leave the room please go go go somewhere else you can you can go get a snack um yeah so everyone's gonna ask about that the first thing you think about the high,790.48,621.843,1494.597
CNET,Gyo6apLIMM4,VR,Apple,resolution headset I was curious as well so um let's just start with with Google YouTube vr180 that's a very popular format YouTube none of that stuff plays in immersive vr10 format on the headset it's surprising because you can do that on a quest and it's it's easy to do and it's very um browser supportive with that so that's not possible and yes out of curiosity to answer this question I did check the site you're probably thinking of and tried an immersive video and just say it did not play in immersive so I'm sorry that is not one of the uses for this headset right now I mean you can play videos in this in the browser Apple's answer so far as to not that but to um the immersive vr10 format is that they're focusing on their own immersive um immersive video platform which is on Apple TV plus and there are questions from them whether it was really compatible or the same resolution you know lots of your headsets 360 and videos and things so I don't think that's a a real answer for that what I'm hoping is that it gets resolved I hope Google makes up with apple I hope Apple makes up with playing immersive videos I hope that all flows together um because right now yeah that's it's also just questions about how much the browser works with web R and other things like that I've seen some things that didn't seem to work and so that there's your answer sorry yeah there's the quest there's the the quest is the the quest is the one that does those things and you've been and again how long have you had the Apple Vision Pro with you yes so I've had the Apple Vision Pro since since last Wednesday so it has only been in a week and two days um so it has been still a really short period of time but I guess longer than many which is I mean I'm glad to have had the time with it but it's still very early days um and I've been doing a lot of stuff on my own one thing I haven't done a ton of is collaborating with people although I had a two-hour call with somebody in FaceTime where they also had a vision Pro and we were doing Persona to Persona chat while I was working and it felt like I was just hanging out with an old friend for a while it was really cool it made me think that there's a lot of collaborative stuff that I really want to know about doing on this headset um and I haven't seen yet and with this I mean you've used a ton of different you know Apple products um not necessarily ones that you've fully reviewed but people want to know exactly how um you think the Apple VR fits into the whole Apple ecosystem yeah so Vision Pro I think down in the like there's the down the road question and there's the right now question question uh start the right now question the right now question is that it's not a replacement for anything that you have it's really in its own territory I think the closest analogy I could think of is the iPad where you know when the iPad came out people were like that's cool but I already have a laptop and I already have a phone so like what do I need this extra product for and I think that in a way the Vision Pro is almost like magic super duper headphones for your eyes but it's more than that and the price is a lot more more than that and it's a standalone thing so not I mean in the sense you can connect your Mac to it and make it an immersive monitor so it could be a way to look at your Mac on a big display but it doesn't do that for other devices yet in the lineup you know it doesn't work with the iPhone or iPad like that um or it doesn't work with the Apple watch so then the rest of it is really like do you want to work on this on its own as a computer and see immersive things in it and so that kind of puts it in its own territory even though though it works a lot of stuff in iCloud but where I think it can go is I I think it could and will work with other Apple's other products you know like Qualcomm who's been leading the way on VR and AR for for a lot of years now uh with most of the products that are out there they've been looking in a lot of solutions that work with phones and I think a lot of stuff we're going to see is a return to some phone connected lightweight glasses that can do um some VR and AR things but use most of the the pH for the processor and battery and it's interesting because Apple may not do that right away but there's no reason why the phone couldn't be held near The Vision Pro and you know why can't you like make things Sprout from it or why couldn't you be watching this on Tik Tok and then just kind of have a bloom into Vision Pro you can do handoffs like you could definitely airdrop or handoff something to watch but I feel like there needs to be there needs to be more of an interconnection between all the devices and you know it's like I'm sure it will happen because Apple's already been doing that like there's already ways you can make the iPhone a camera for your laptop or you know make the iPad an xplay for your Mac and I I think those interconnections are really Apple's strongest territory here what they can do because they already have this family of products that they um keep very maintained YouTube our questions sorry uh we have um more of course about the Vision Pro uh we have one from online vid and they want to know is it possible to transfer transfer spatial videos from an iPhone 15 Pro to the V Vision Pro without going through iCloud yeah you can always airdrop them in so um in fact I did that with a demo with apple where I was using their headset and it wasn't on my iCloud account so I just aird dropped stuff over and it played um so all those things you that's like the that's basically the way to do it there's no USBC port or anything so you can't directly plug in and sync it will all have to be Wireless in some form uh but but you basically are going to be able to either do it through airdrop or yeah you're going to kind of triangulate through iCloud or fi or the files app which again is kind of you know kind of a similar thing with iCloud so yeah that's that's kind of how it works and by the way y sorry I I I I don't know if people were interested but I can also show you some of these accessories this is the Cozy that comes with it which I call it the Cozy that covers up the display it's actually like pretty essential because this is glass here and aluminum and I would not want to break it or scratch it and Apple only recommends using a microfiber cloth to polish it so I just keep this on to cover it all the time qu it's also padded and these things magnetically snap on and off which is super easy but don't grab the headset by these face pieces because they'll just fall off and yeah these straps just come off by pulling the orange tabs it's actually super simple which once I understood that it was easy I like the way the accessories attach meta please do things like this because I feel like they're a lot easier they're more expensive but they're a lot easier to detach this is the uglier of the two head straps by the way but much more comfortable looks like a CPAP strap the one that Apple also includes with the headset is the solo knit which is super cool but also feels fatiguing after a little while it's great for casual sharing and they also just snap on so I just want to show you that but yeah um that's you're given us a demo just like what people would get in the stores today because you know it is uh the launch day and you can get demos done of the Vision Pro in Apple Stores starting today um another question for you though from YouTube uh Jim Monroy wants to know can you mirror an iPad like you can with the Mac no and that's so weird to me to me thank you for asking that because I when I first heard about Vision Pro I thought the device it would work with was the iPad because it actually shares the iPad app ecosystem and I think that the reason that Apple made it connect with the Mac first is because the fact that Mac apps will be left out of the loop here because this is running iPad and iOS stuff and then you might say well I have a Mac thing what do I do so they made this ability to mirror the Mac monitor which is great but I totally agree with you I think that also the iPad is smaller so you know I'm already using an iPad with the magic keyboard I just feel like the the great pairing with this would be that you work on your iPad with the keyboard and the trackpad and then you have the headset on and it's more Compact and so hopefully they'll do that same thing with you canot you can't mirror an iPhone um which is weird because you you'd think you can look at the iPhone and iPad through the pass through cameras and then just kind of work on it which is weird but you could do that but I I want it where you can hold it up and then it just kind of turns into a virtual iPhone or iPad and you can do that but you know maybe that will happen and we have a another question from IG and from Instagram uh from Kel it's so like talking about you know the ways in which that the Apple Vision Pro can be used it's not like a computer it's more like a monitor or you know it's there certain way you would say it's more useful or I mean spal Computing is what they're saying oh yeah so in terms of how you can use the Vision Pro is it just like a monitor or is it a computer no it's definitely a computer so what's interesting is there's the monitor part of it which is that it will do a Mac virtual display but it runs apps and downloads apps so basically think of it like an iPad you can download I mean it's a very expensive iPad but you can download tons of apps um onto it as many as will fit in storage there are games there are productivity apps I think they have 600 apps at launch which is a lot um but a lot of them are like little things and little you know it's like the early days of the iPhone app store experimental little jokey things or serious things and then there are also compatible apps just iPad apps and there were like apple said there were like a million of those so not every app that's on the iPad app store they're definitely missing ones like Netflix or or YouTube or or Gmail but there're a lot on there too so you can just keep downloading those and using those and you don't need a Mac or anything else you can pair keyboard and trackpad and just work on this you could just work like I've done that and I think that would be an amazing way to work except for the fact that some of the interface stuff is still a little bit weird um totally works with trackpad and keyboard the ey in hand tracking sometimes on very small icons on not Vision Pro optimized apps are a little hard to focus and click on so and also in Safari so I I would love a 3D version of a trackpad something that like you know if Apple made a control that you could just like browse easily um but they don't have anything like that yet also before can I tell you too about the case I just want to show I'm just gonna be like toys how much curious now that's actually not there are cases that cost that much in the world but that's more than meta's accessories this is the only carrying case that Apple sells and I'm sure there'll be a lot more um I I do think you should have a case for the Vision Pro one that protects it really well um this case feels like a North Face jacket on the outside it's like um feels like a parka and then inside it's um it's firm but padded there's like a microfiber has a little pouch for carrying accessories you can put your charge cable which comes with it in there your battery tucks into this thing which is a little strange I wish there was a little more secure connection for the battery but then the headset goes in here the one important thing about this case and what where I think you'd want to be careful with finding cases is that Apple has this nice cozy here but they don't have anything to protect the lenses which is a little strange there's no cover here I get worried about the lenses so this um this case tucks in and the lenses you can adjust it the lenses get protected here I just feel like I that's what I want to care about um and then you can put stuff in here I wish this had like an extra compartment or pocket you know hovering the battery above it makes me,1613.6,621.843,1491.638000000001
CNET,Gyo6apLIMM4,VR,Apple,nervous like if you tighten it it goes on top but the the case is nice and sturdy there's no real better option um but that does not come included the straps come included the extra straps but not the carrying case and going with that people want to know I mean on Tik Tok we had a question have you dropped it and how durable you think it is I know you have to be really careful when taking off the Vision Pro because of how parts are magnetic and you just don't it could literally just drop yeah I've not dropped it I'm sorry and I don't intend to um because apple is all I mean look we could somebody could buy one and drop it we didn't we didn't buy one for a drop test yet but I'll tell you if we will the um to me it's like um you know what would happen if you dropped a a like a Mac Pro on the ground like it's not good you know like I it's not an iPhone is made for dropping I IP ads are not really made for dropping this is I think definitely not made for dropping though Apple claims that they've done drop test and durability tests and that it um will be okay I could just see the glass shattering here um I it just I I don't I don't feel positive about what would happen because it's very dense and metal and glass um I think unfortunately I don't usually like recommending protection plans for products if they don't aren't absolutely necessary but with something this new it feels like a protection plan is kind of a must and the unfortunate thing is that the plan that Apple sells is $500 but um but we'll protect it I think against multiple cases of damage and we just don't know what's going to happen with this thing plus there's a lot of um you know VR headsets have a lot of pieces that could get loose or or damaged or what happens to this what happens to this overtime or you know what if there's something that lenses are a little motorized there's a lot you know there's a lot of things that you know we just don't know with this and there's another chat so much about the battery to also just go in another direction from YouTube this chat's from I'm sorry if I mispronounce your name wrong IB IBN alhakeem he's asking is it possible to use the battery as an emergency power bank for your iPhone via the USBC Port I'm not sure if you've tried that I have not tried it that is an interesting question I could try it right now should we just try it let's just I mean I have a USBC cable right here so let's just find out I weirdly didn't do this before I was gonna say no but let's just let's just see um we'll we'll find out what happens learn something new every day especially with this kind of product nope nope oh wait no on a second I'm going to try one more time it said accessory connected and Travis thanks for asking on YouTube I have not tried the Vision Pro un fortunately maybe one day maybe I'll get a demo I think the answer is no the answer is no this doesn't do that in fact what it might be doing is pulling the B battery from your phone charging the Vision Pro battery because because USBC will do that so no it won't it won't do that it won't charge it up it's purely for the Vision Pro it's a very particular battery sorry to bother you about that I'm not sorry to bother you sorry to disappoint you but the the other thing is that if you're going to carry this to go then you're going to want to this is a giant power bank but you're going to need to be sort of living like this where you're going to have a battery and then another battery to charge up this battery possibly or which you could do or just a a power plug so yeah that's kind of I wonder if Apple will sell larger capacity batteries that's another possibility I mean if they made them this big why not make them uh twice as big and maybe hopefully not twice as expensive very true going into that we have a lot of questions from Instagram and Tik Tok too about like verses because you you're arv expert arvr expert you've tried pretty much I'm not going to say all of the VR experts VR AR head headsets on the market because there's so many but specifically people on Instagram and TK talk are asking about the hollow lens and also of course the one you expect the quest three so um you know if you want to talk about some of your verses and your thoughts on these other um headsets on the market with I am oh is that okay thank you I have not a quest 3 unfortunately but I have something that kind of bridges the Gap I have a quest Pro which almost like what you said it's it's like both kind of um Quest 3 is at home but actually this is the this is probably the best comparison in a lot of ways because the quest Pro is meta headset that has eye and face tracking um and I didn't include the battery pack here so let's let's let's not forget that there's a battery pack with the Vision Pro that's not that's not a um that's not a self-contained thing so include that but you can see that and also Al the quest Pro comes with um a cover for its glass cover that there's some similarities here I mean sizewise the Vision Pro is very VR headset like I mean when I first saw it I was like yeah this is like Apple's design version of the quest 3 um I mean the quest pro has a more Hollow lens like plastic uh band design with the battery in the back which is something that um a lot of headsets do go with and it balances the weight better uh the lenses here are bigger on the quest Pro but there's definitely some similarities going on how they compare so I think I think in a lot of ways the quest Pro is kind of like a replacement for air headsets like Hollins and magically and not entirely the same thing but a lot of these pass through um VR headsets are basically giving you the ability to float virtual objects in the real world in the same way that Hollens was doing and it's interesting is Hollens also I think they were the first ones that had a pinch and tap uh and you know interface with eye tracking so in a way what Apple's doing with their headset feels like it's almost coming from Hollow lens but with the potential to do more advanced hand tracking too whereas the quest also has hand tracking but the hand tracking is not quite pinch based it is well it is actually when I did the interface recently it is like a laser pointer that you're pinching but um it feels a little more like you're throwing a laser pointer because there's no ey tracking um even the quest Pro which has ey tracking doesn't have it on for the interface that's a big difference and it's for battery savings I mean Apple basically was like we're going to keep it on all the time but we're gonna have this giant battery um Quest Pro we're not going to have it on all the time no giant battery and Quest Pro uses I and and um face tracking for Avatar so if there's Avatar use for it but a lot of times it's not turned on and and there's no optic ID the other interesting thing that Apple did that I haven't seen on another headset is do authorizations with an iris scan that so for payments on other ones it's usually like a PIN code and which is not great there's no uh Touch ID or anything on the no fingerprint sensor on the quest Pro so I think optic ID is really big for doing purchases and doing things like that but you can see the the fit feels differently what you know but the quest Pro fits over my glasses that's the thing it's still a bit of a tight fit like it definitely comes right up to my glasses but it works and with this on with the with the peripheral vision I always thought the quest Pro reminded me of Hollin where you can get peripheral view Apple really seals off I mean they call it the light seal but they really seal off the outside world in exchange you can see the outside world through the display but you're not going to see see someone come up of the Corn out of the corner of your eye with the quest Pro on you're going to see them with the um you know through the cameras on this but I think to answer that even a little bit further um I think what Apple's doing with the with the quality of the pass through and the quality of the display and the Hand tracking verely in your world then pretty much any mixed reality headset I've ever tried and that's a real Difference Maker um so it's not quite AR some people who work in industrial AR I me if you want we could talk all all the way down the road about this some people work in industrial AR and training have been very adamant in the past saying like it's not the same thing because if you're working on a factory floor you could get seriously damaged um using past through cameras because you have to see your real vision unimpeded and uh that's why I also would say do not cook while wearing a quest A Vision Pro don't don't do cooking don't do don't ride your bicycle um yes it has very very good low latency but you're still looking at this through a display that could fail and I already cut my finger once without a Vision Pro on like don't don't do that but I think that that's a big difference in in um in that Ser see-through technology that eventually we'll see in glasses but I think it's like really high quality and that is really intriguing and we had a we had a question from Instagram from the chaotic snob asking going on this because you've been using it quite a bit obviously past week and few days do you feel like it's been giving you eye strain at all no but I am thinking about that because anytime you spend a lot of time in VR it could produce eye strain Apple recommends that you take breaks everyone in VR recommends you take breaks they recommend also that you not be 13 years old uh well you be 13 and older you know they're not meant for kids um I use prescription lenses with mine if I've been using it for an hour which sometimes I do I slip into Worlds in here and I kind of forget them in the headset I take it off it kind of feels like I've been reading for a while where I just go like like I need to do something else it's an interesting question for long-term use I think there needs to be more thought about this I do think there can be eye strain and your eyes are focusing differently too you know you're you're um there's something called like Vera focal displays that companies like meta are working on they want you to be able to focus at different distances like your eyes do in VR you're not actually doing that everything is the screen is always a certain distance and your eyes are kind of you know uh I don't know what you call it but they're kind of like relaxing into seeing the 3D and there can be strain from that and there could be some fatigue so I would say um it's unclear after a week but there are times where I feel like I need a little bit of a break um yeah I bet and that's a good question about using it as a computer you know you know if you're going to be working on something people can be at their computer for like hours and what would happen if you're in the Vision Pro for hours and hours I think the longest I've been at now was like two hours and it felt it felt fun but then I was like wow I can't believe I've been in that so long hello real world you know like that that was the feeling I had uh even though I was in my world and then also like one of the biggest things with apple is just fine my like in case you lose it I think this would be a pretty hard object to lose uh but on Instagram mancer wondered if does it have find my support I'm you I'm not sure let's find out I'm gonna go on I'm gonna go onto my uh my phone and see if the Vision Pro shows up I actually haven't tried this um oh wait it's not plugged in so I'm G to plug it in and then I'm going to let this thing start up let's see what happens I feel like it might um but I don't know I don't know it's interesting question the big problem though as you just noticed the big problem with why fine my would have an issue is that when you detach this,2369.319,621.843,1501.8749999999995
CNET,Gyo6apLIMM4,VR,Apple,"battery it's off like off off and fine my works with devices that are in standby you know like your your macbook's in standby your phones in standby these things are still kind of on with a battery charge able to do something so I don't know what happens maybe it tells you the last time you've used it I didn't see it on my list of fi though but I'm gonna have to confirm that okay yeah no worries we can go through that um uh another question though which is actually funny because I Bridget's one more thing episode just came on and we kind of touched on this a little bit from YouTube Richard C wants to know can people with it and use other P people's faces for face scanning or does it confirm you will you be able to download Face scans and use as your own that's a lot of questions but um we kind of did a little bit because you know Bridget got to use yours right and when we one more thing and as I'm looking for fine mine I do not see the device showing up so that may be an answer there the um can you use someone else's Persona so it's interesting the question basically is no know but so Persona is set up to your Apple ID and it's on device so Apple was adamant that it gets scanned one Persona per person uh for the device and you can't have multiple ones as a result and if you you could always redo it so you could hold it in front of you and rescan your persona it's always a photo real scan based on your your face scan and it's meant to just really represent you and then you have optic ID to log in so that it would have to you know do the optic ID to confirm you if somebody else put the headset on well then they you know say no it's not you and you couldn't use that and guest mode which I tried with Bridget does not have any Persona set up now that being said you don't have to have optic ID on and you could also use passcode and we tried doing a passcode enter entry and Bridget's my eyes seemed to be on Bridget's face when she was using the headset but we did not ahead and fully have her make FaceTime calls we're going to do that see what happens I'm also really curious if I can like scan someone else's face here in the office as my face for Persona I would think the answer is yes because it's not um it's not doing any fa you know Apple's not doing face authentication here to confirm that it's you so I think I could um that being said I'm not sure so that is an interesting question and I don't know the full answer to yet but the thing is that it's not it's not like your persona is being stored on iCloud and it's not something that someone could log in and use even if someone had somehow had access to your account they need that particular headset to you like it's only stored on there so and so still so many questions coming in we love it um another one from Tik Tock from a row r e Au X um Can it use PC VR no it can't use PC VR at all and so that's a big um that's a big disconnect for anyone who's in the VR landscape now who thinks about you know like the quest has a huge Fringe benefit or main benefit for people in that it can be a VR headset for PC and so it can be Standalone but it can also connect to a PC and that just gives it tremendous flexibility for what you'd be doing apple is only limiting it to their particular ecosystem of apps and their family of products so that's going to shut a lot of people out and it's also making apple rebuild a whole new landscape Without Partners that have been in the space for a while and there's definitely tension with that you know I've already seen a lot of developers that are wondering how they're going to do stuff with this or if they're going to do stuff with this and um I think this is very much like apple enter in other spaces you know with the phone particularly and and I think there'll be some some companies that play with it I'm really curious if Apple if uh particularly Google and even meta start finding ways to work with this because people talk about like the you know Rising tide lifting all boats in the industry that this is you know in a lot of ways the presence of a $3,500 Vision Pro headset makes the idea of a quest three see really reasonable and you know well you could get that and so it's actually not a threat maybe it's helpful and you already can use some Apple products like the iPhone and things with meta maybe these things will dub tail a bit but you know hopefully and then but not right now we're almost at time at 12 but I'm gonna um ask you one more question and then yeah I know time flies and people had so many questions do this for 35 hours if anyone wants to just keep hanging out forever to do this hey if you guys want Scott is on a bunch of social platforms we'll give them to you in a few but um a last question I have for you is from Instagram maners asked Can you drag a window start walking and hold the app window while you're walking like you're holding a virtual smartphone or tablet in there yes and so that's a good question I need to do more of this but you can it's so weird I like okay so I was using it in my office and I went to the bathroom and then um I just dragged the window with me and like took it to me I went to the bathroom honestly that's just what I did and yeah it FL it floated there and then I dragged it back but it's also weird because much like the quest it's the same thing the quest does that if you walk to another room you can see through the walls basically and like you could see that the window is still hanging out in your office so like it doesn't leave the space that you were in because this doesn't do any room setup that's the other weird thing there's no room set so it just kind of leaves things wherever and just like keeps track of space somehow and so like I just had to look over I tried to open a browser and I was like where is it oh it's in the office over there I see it through the wall or like I see it floating over there so I had to like grab it and drag it or like tell Siri to close it so yes I'm curious how that will work throughout my entire house more to come on that yeah Scott has uh for anyone joining us we are wrapping up this live um a Q&A with our Fe of 10 over 10 years experience Scott Stein and um gez I almost lost my train of thought but we were I did too we were on Tik Tok face he has a review basically that's what I was getting to he has a review we're gonna have more videos to come on all of our platforms on social and on YouTube on Tik Tok Instagram so definitely uh stay tuned for more and also check those out if you haven't already um because we feel bad we can't show you guys exactly what he means or what he's touching with or can see with field of view and just like the screens itself but you can get a look there um and for Scott too let's uh also say the pricing of this stuff because it was an apple Vision Pro at least basic pricing it's $3,500 um someone battery the case yeah there's there's a lot more um oh I'm GNA put this on again to I talk because it's fun I'm entering my passcode so when you when you do this you have to like or you can like reach out and tap the pass passcode it's just like any other Apple device you got to enter the passcode when you come back in then it has to connect my airpods which I'm not going to do because I'm using them for the Tik Tok live but the price basically starts no I don't want to remove that app um as I'm gesturing I'm accidentally doing things so the price starts at $3,500 for the headset with 256 gigabytes of storage it's got the battery it's got two straps Two Face pads at different thicknesses um and the Cozy and the charge cable but the case is $200 which again you don't need it but you got to have some I think you'd want some way to protect it you could just keep it on your desk um if you want to increase the storage it's $200 per storage tier so two $200 get to 512 $200 to get to um one terabyte then there's Apple Care Plus which I think is $500 I'm remembering this then if you want to get extra well if you want to get prescription lenses it's 100 or 150 for reader or prescription Zeiss inserts then there's Apple Care I just mentioned that then there's um extra face pad stuff like if you want to share this with people you might want to get uh that light seal I think is 200 just that little piece between the the face padding and the headset the actual face pads are like 30 the straps believe Bridget were saying I think or 100 each there's a lot there's a lot of stuff here that adds up like you easily easily will probably walk out spending $4,000 because between if you're getting Apple Care or you're getting a case or you're getting a something else um so it's just a lot um it just keeps adding up and then by the way you're GNA want to buy apps you know like there's like like Services Al some of the apps get expensive I've seen some things in there that are you know $20 $30 $50 for one uh some of them are just $2 you know it's it's unclear where the prices are going to fall and some things like um HBO Max which is on this or Max uh the premium tier is the only one that you get the super immersive Dolby Atmos stuff in so you have to pay up to the extra subscription tier so in a way like is it going to be premium headset premium products premium subscriptions you know it could be because um that's where this is kind of aiming for so I just wanted to bring up that there are definitely added costs with this headset I mean I I I don't know about spending $3500 on that but I can people credit that can you know let me be absolutely clear because I said this in the review I would not recommend that family or friends or people I know buy the headset it's way too much money it it is fascinating it is often amazing in terms of what it's showing as an experience like by all means what you do is you get a demo and I think that's what apple is counting on is that you be blown away by the demo but like go go for the demo see the cool stuff think about it but in the meantime a quest 3 is a really great way to dive into a ton of things and to me that is the $500 thing you get that plays with mixed reality that's not the that's not the Vision Pro Plus it does Fitness because I do Fitness in VR and it's how I've been focusing on getting healthier and I love it like Supernatural a lot of people I know do it and we didn't talk about this but the quest Pro does not have Fitness it has a couple of meditation apps but there's no integration with heart rate on Apple watch or anything like that I don't think you should walk around a lot with this so I think that's a huge part of what VR is to me right now weirdly enough is active Fitness games and that's missing here too so that what I would say is like this's a fascinating product but just I want to see what else it turns into as well thank you so much Scott and thank you everyone on Tik Tok Instagram and YouTube for bearing with us some technical difficulties in the beginning and just hanging with us um with Scott we going have to bring you back for another one people love all this so umt follow we've been three

CNET,xnl1nKTp52Q,VR,Apple,FaceTime video from Scott you look like Scott but like from an alternate universe so do you know what you look like what are you doing do you know what,0.04,621.843,17.159999999999997

CNET,xnl1nKTp52Q,VR,Apple,honored that was so weird but strangely realistic in a in a way that I wasn't expecting like I didn't it didn't jar me as much as I thought it was going to apart from that initial View and then I got used to it and I could almost I could almost think that I was talking to the real Scott,36.559,621.843,47.562
CNET,CG8UbTEGmQI,VR,Apple,[Music] this was a little trippy this was not what I expected from what I saw before with apple uh it looks,0.0,621.843,18.959
CNET,CG8UbTEGmQI,VR,Apple,like his real eyes are reacting very quickly but they're so muddied and deep in there that I can't tell it's this cartoon Persona thing so it definitely,8.519,621.843,23.641000000000002
CNET,CG8UbTEGmQI,VR,Apple,helps with that uncanny valley effect is not happen here it just looks like he's wearing heavy goggles that I can't really see in there like Scott are you,20.48,621.843,19.758000000000003
CNET,CG8UbTEGmQI,VR,Apple,in there I I I can see he's in there he's in there he's blinking he's reacting to real time so I am impressed with that but now I have to like I I I,30.679,621.843,17.922
CNET,CG8UbTEGmQI,VR,Apple,just want to look at his eyes the whole time and keep studying it I think after 5 minutes I'm used to it though am I,39.84,621.843,18.68
CNET,aJCXImHdTYY,VR,Apple,"[Music] Apple's Vision Pro I just checked it out and if you want to know what's inside the box for $3,500 or more this is what",0.11,621.843,18.928
CNET,aJCXImHdTYY,VR,Apple,I found inside first of all the Vision Pro itself which is here plus a little Vision Pro cozy that covers the front there are also two different straps,9.519,621.843,17.681
CNET,aJCXImHdTYY,VR,Apple,there's the solo one and the Dual Loop strap which is the battery pack which is essential that comes with it two and USBC charger and brick 30 wat an extra,18.279,621.843,21.0
CNET,aJCXImHdTYY,VR,Apple,little cushion for the light seal which is in case your lenses should you get prescription lenses or your eyes need a slightly different depth fit then,29.199,621.843,15.84
CNET,aJCXImHdTYY,VR,Apple,there's a polishing cloth Apple's polishing cloth and an instruction manual there's actually instruction manual that uh kind of guides you through some of the initial setup some pictures and some tips which is unusual for an Apple product,37.12,621.843,28.681
CNET,pjxgkG53C38,VR,Apple,[Music] so here's what I've been noticing about Apple Vision Pro so far after just a few days using it first of all what I love,0.0,621.843,16.641
CNET,pjxgkG53C38,VR,Apple,is the cinema quality playing movies on this thing is fantastic and I think the iron hand tracking stuff is really fascinating and sometimes weird also the,8.12,621.843,18.399
CNET,pjxgkG53C38,VR,Apple,multitasking with all sorts of apps that I already use really starts to feel like a floating computer the weird things that eye and hand tracking a lot of,17.359,621.843,19.12
CNET,pjxgkG53C38,VR,Apple,times the eye tracking sometimes doesn't feel as precise as I want it to be and I feel like I'm missing the mark and it's a little Annoying to reach out and grab,26.679,621.843,16.36
CNET,pjxgkG53C38,VR,Apple,things also this battery and the cord this gets annoying I mean you have to tuck this in your pocket I wish this was all built in here but this is step one on a very expensive headset stay tuned for more impressions as we use it more,34.48,621.843,27.961
CNET,B4-yO8KALao,VR,Meta,[Music] the new meta Quest 3 is the best VR headset for $500 but here's why we picked the meta Quest 2 for editor's,0.0,621.843,20.0
CNET,B4-yO8KALao,VR,Meta,choice for the holiday season right now spending money on anything is a challenge for a lot of people and at $250 which is what it's on sale for The,10.84,621.843,15.64
CNET,B4-yO8KALao,VR,Meta,Meta Quest 2 is half the price of the quest 3 and it's still perfectly good at running a lot of games apps and yes Fitness and workouts so while it may get,18.72,621.843,17.798
CNET,B4-yO8KALao,VR,Meta,outdated in the next couple of years and it does doesn't have the best graphics compared to the quest 3 and the Optics aren't quite as good it's still,27.599,621.843,13.242
CNET,B4-yO8KALao,VR,Meta,perfectly functional and that's why we're recommending it if you have more money to spend then sure consider the quest three,34.52,621.843,14.759999999999998
CNET,rMP19wUSzeQ,VR,Meta,here's how to upload large video files with the quest 3 headset that will not sync with the meta app now unfortunately the meta app will not sync large video,0.04,621.843,19.039
CNET,rMP19wUSzeQ,VR,Meta,files so in order to do that you simply go to the medaquest browser and log into your personal storage account like Google Drive go to Google Drive and,9.4,621.843,16.641
CNET,rMP19wUSzeQ,VR,Meta,it'll probably ask for your permission to access the medaquest headset and from here you can upload large files to Google Drive so I'm going to go file,18.16,621.843,17.479
CNET,rMP19wUSzeQ,VR,Meta,upload and I have a video here that is 19 minutes long 2.3 gigs select and boom it's uploading it will upload that large video file for you which you can then,26.199,621.843,23.081
CNET,rMP19wUSzeQ,VR,Meta,download on your computer and you're good to go now I'm sure this will probably work similarly on one drive and Dropbox I haven't tried it but leave a comment if it works,38.36,621.843,19.798
CNET,WSuYWXpyGw0,VR,Meta,today I'm going to show you how to add multiple users to your medaquest 3 headset and set up a parent managed account subscribe to CET for more how-to videos adding multiple accounts on the quest 3 is pretty simple and if you have small kids that want to play you're going to want to have some parental controls in place like time limits and locks apps your main account is the admin and then you can have three additional accounts on the quest 3 and Quest 2 the Advent account can share all the purchase apps on the headset with all the users to share your apps put on the quest 3 headset and pull up the universal menu by pressing the menu button on the rightand controller and select settings then select accounts and toggle,0.04,621.843,84.8
CNET,WSuYWXpyGw0,VR,Meta,on the app sharing switch now you're sharing all your purchase apps from The Meta Quest store it's worth noting that you cannot share apps across different headsets so I can't share my apps with multiple users on my meta quest Quest 2 if I have toggled this switch on in the meta Quest 3 you can switch it off and go back to the Quest 2 if needed now you need to create meta accounts for each user as you can see I already created accounts for my kids if you don't have a meta account you can create one or log in with your Facebook account and merge your account for this video I'll set up a new account for a fictional child so you can see how the process works create a new meta account for your child by going to the Meta Family Center and log,42.16,621.843,81.68
CNET,WSuYWXpyGw0,VR,Meta,into your existing meta account next select create an account for a child from the options available and follow the onscreen instructions you can also invite a team to create an account on the headset your child must be between 10 and 12 years old to have a parent supervised meta account this age limit varies by region the child account has privacy and security features on by default and they cannot be changed until the child turns 13 once a child turns 13 they will be automatically opted into a supervised account but the parent and team can decide whether to keep the supervised account and turn off certain features their name birth date and an email address are required re ired to complete the setup process I've dropped a link in the description of this video,82.56,621.843,81.959
CNET,WSuYWXpyGw0,VR,Meta,to meta's page for creating a child or teen account in The Meta Family Center and for converting an existing meta account to a child's account if you need more information you can also set up and manage a parent supervised account in The Meta app if you prefer doing everything on mobile you can access parental supervision settings including daily time limits scheduled breaks and locked apps from The Meta app now that the child account is set up you can add a user to the headset put the headset back on and go to settings and select accounts again and then select add account you will be prompted to create an unlock pattern for your headset if you don't already have one set up before adding additional accounts you will now see an 8-digit code in your headset on,123.68,621.843,85.321
CNET,WSuYWXpyGw0,VR,Meta,your mobile phone go to mea.com device and enter the 8-digit code once the new user account is added you can add your name and create a username that will be visible to other Quest players the new account will be added and your heads will begin to walk your child through all the safety features on the medaquest 3 until the headset is comfortable and text on the screen is clear to change user select the user profile icon on the far left hand side of the universal menu and then select switch user on the top right so that's how to add a new account to have multiple users sharing one headset if you like this video give us a like And subscribe to cat's massive YouTube channel and let us know in the comments if you have any tips for adding multiple users on the headset and thanks for watching,166.04,621.843,91.11999999999999
CNET,6FwqdGfuyIk,VR,Meta,meta's newest VR headset the quest 3 is here what's in the box well we took a look at the 512 GB model they're both packaged the same inside you got the,0.04,621.843,21.52
CNET,6FwqdGfuyIk,VR,Meta,headset with its new cameras and new design and two controllers like alwayss here the controllers are a lot smaller meta also includes a charge cable USBC,10.759,621.843,26.0
CNET,6FwqdGfuyIk,VR,Meta,and a little charge plug that's it that's all that's in the Box for the quest 3 if you want to consider accessories there are a lot of others,23.72,621.843,16.92
CNET,6FwqdGfuyIk,VR,Meta,meta makes its own case there's a charge dock there's also a variety of different types of straps and headbands and even active wristbands for the quest 3,32.239,621.843,19.36
CNET,6FwqdGfuyIk,VR,Meta,controllers but those will cost you possibly up to $130 depending on the accessory check out our whole review on CNET and a lot more,41.96,621.843,21.879
CNET,ixxqeiB1qpQ,VR,Meta,meta's newest VR headset the quest 3 is here it's got better graphics a better processor it's got better resolution better lenses and smaller controllers it also has mixed reality which blends the,0.04,621.843,21.881
CNET,ixxqeiB1qpQ,VR,Meta,virtual and real world something that Apple's Vision Pro is going to offer too this doesn't have ey tracking but it has a lot of other capabilities on here still it plays similar games to The,11.36,621.843,19.878999999999998
CNET,ixxqeiB1qpQ,VR,Meta,Quest 2 the cameras are improved they're good enough to look at your phone or look at your watch to check for messages but still not so great that you'd want to watch a TV show while wearing them,21.0,621.843,20.839999999999996
CNET,ixxqeiB1qpQ,VR,Meta,but you can do a lot with the quest 3 I'm just curious how much more met is going to allow it to do next year is it worth getting well consider whether you want to wait for the new apps that,31.519,621.843,19.52
CNET,ixxqeiB1qpQ,VR,Meta,really take advantage of it cuz right now day one I haven't seen all that much yet but the capabilities here are pretty great and it's probably going to be the most affordable great VR headset next year and this year,41.48,621.843,26.481
CNET,JpCvsSpbinc,VR,Meta,our favorite headset has been The Meta Quest 2 for years now there's an update the meta Quest 3 and a year full of VR headsets how does this new one compare and is it the one to get over the Quest 2 here's what you need to know so I've been using the meta Quest 3 for about a week so far and there's a lot of things that I'm observing the first thing you need to know is what's new well there's a lot of upgrades here first of all there's a new processor qualcom Snapdragon xr2 Gen 2 better graphics better speed there's higher resolution better lenses they're clearer it's got a wider field of view it's got added cameras here the controllers are smaller but what meta is really pushing here is mixed reality mixed reality is the ability to blend virtual reality with what your cameras on your headset see in the real world it's called pass through mixed reality as opposed to when when you wear an AR glasses setup that allows you to actually see the real world with ghostly AR images overlap and it's the type of technology that you're going to see on the Apple Vision Pro and probably future VR headsets because qualcomm's Chip is going to be in a lot of others down the line one fun thing is I can actually show you what mixed reality looks like thanks to the fact that the quest 3 can capture that footage and send it over to the phone app The Meta Quest 3 basically gives you the type of experience with mixed reality that's sort of like what magically promised way back the ability to mesh your room to scan your environment and to layer virtual things into it there are a couple of apps that already do this one is a demo game app that meta has on the quest 3 called first encounters that allows you to have things crash out of the walls into your room and you're shooting little creatures and it's it's the most wild and fun demo that's on the,3.679,621.843,226.75899999999996
CNET,JpCvsSpbinc,VR,Meta,headset right now it's it's great but also it can feel a little bit gimmicky the question is what else are you going to do with it well the quest Pro met his ey tracking headset that came out last year also did some mixed reality but there's a depth sensing camera here in addition to much improved color cameras that make that mixed reality feel more real met is betting that you'll care about that but we need the apps and the games and the experiences that are going to make us feel what that difference is right now week one I've only seen a handful of apps that are using it not a lot of killer apps I'm really ious how well it gets introduced on a larger scale across meta's software platform how does it differ from the Quest 2 well this is the thing in good ways and bad ways it's basically the same proposition it runs Quest 2 apps it has the same software ecosystem you can run those games you have the same type of screen with all the apps anything that you're used to with what VR is on the quest that's carrying over into the quest 3 that also kind of makes it feel like an upgraded phone or a tablet so in that that sense I was expecting maybe a little bit more of a transformed environment it does start in mixed reality but meta kind of did that a little bit before on the Quest 2 and the quest Pro the quest 2's design is kind of similar to The Quest 3 even though it is smaller uh up front it's got about the same weight it has a similar type of strap attachment so it's elastic straps and you can pop out other types of accessories and add them on if you want like an elite strap the controllers are smaller so they got rid of that big plastic tracking ring but the grip and the button placement everything pretty much is the same otherwise which is great if you really like the feel of the Quest 2 controllers it still charges,116.759,621.843,208.92200000000003
CNET,JpCvsSpbinc,VR,Meta,"with USBC it still has a headphone jack and it still puts a little uh audio into your ear through these speakers that are near your ear that people can hear but it's a little bit like it's intimate the quest 3 does not have eye tracking neither does the Quest 2 the quest Pro does and Apple's Vision Pro and the PlayStation VR to do have eye tracking now it's not a really big loss right now but if you're looking for a way to transform your interactions with VR it could be a Miss down the road because apple is betting that it tracking plus hand tracking equals a whole new interface meta does have hand tracking that'll probably get better but there is no eye tracking so you may want to still default to those controllers battery life it's expected to be about the same which is about 2 hours more or less so far I found that it's enough to play for a while in the evening and then I'm going to want to look to charge it up the controllers still use AA batteries much like the Quest 2 and those had a really good battery life or you could even put in these fancy contactless batteries for charging but those come with the quest 3 charging dock from meta which I'm showing off right here very nice and very expensive it's $130 that's a lot of money there are a number of accessories that met is already selling for the quest 3 ranging from an elite strap that has a better fit there's an elite strap with battery pack which I didn't try there's a carrying case there's this charge dock those are all going to cost you $70 for the case $1 130 for the charge dock $70 for the elite strap and the base model of the quest 3 is $500 if you want to get the one with 512 GB of storage that's $650 so if you start buying a lot of accessories this could be close to $1,000 proposition that's a lot of money",221.0,621.843,202.16
CNET,JpCvsSpbinc,VR,Meta,"but you could get in with just the $500 one and charge it up with USBC and just get some type of a case maybe a cheaper one I would recommend a case and you don't really need all the other stuff let's take a moment and think about the future what is going to happen in VR and AR down the road well it's a big unknown of course but there are a lot of products coming next year those products are going to likely Define a new landscape for computing maybe with Apple's case certainly floating 2D apps and an app ecosystem Samsung and Google might try to do the same where does that leave meta is it some sort of advanced Computing platform well you already can use this as a monitor for working uh on your computer just like you can with the Quest 2 the resolution on this display is more than good enough for doing work in and even for watching TV shows and floating them in your room with you it's not Cinema quality in the way that I felt with the Apple Vision Pro but that's a $3500 headset the interesting thing here is that for $3,000 less yes $3,000 less you could get a lot of those experiences to play around with for 500 bucks and meta also has a number of fitness apps that type of full motion activity stuff boxing or beat saer which has not been updated for mixed reality yet those things are what make the quest a really interesting proposition compared to PlayStation VR2 or even Apple Vision Pro down the road you know in 2020 it was a no-brainer upgrade the Quest 2 was a better product and it was $100 less expensive now the quest 3 is a better product all around and will probably be the best VR headset at this price but it is $200 more now if you have a Quest 2 right now I think you're okay waiting because a lot of the apps right now have not been updated and the quest 3 is going to wait for those apps and if not a lot of people own it yet",322.44,621.843,233.56000000000006
CNET,JpCvsSpbinc,VR,Meta,maybe developers are not going to all jump on board unless meta pushes them but next year 6 months down the road it could all change the quest has evolved over time and adding hand tracking adding all sorts of experimental features met is going to be adding AI features on board this next year so this could really turn into a very different product and at some point The Quest 2 won't be supported and this will be the product this $500 device it's remarkable what it includes on it and all the features and the resolution and everything else that makes it a really really cool product maybe not a must have upgrade yet but I bet by the time all these headsets hit next year this will still be the most affordable one and that makes it a real really interesting device game console whatever else you want it to be to explore AR and VR as a game console it's definitely iterative but I think it's going to become one of the best gaming VR experiences that's around oh and by the way did I mention it also works with your PC so for that alone and for its high resolution it could be an excellent pick so here are things I like and dislike about the quest 3 what I like the graphics are better the display and the lenses are a lot better and it can do mixed reality which is a really cool trick what I don't like it's $200 more expensive the battery life has not changed and meta hasn't figured out any other way that this will work with apps and other software ecosystems that's any different than the way Quest already did anyway if you have more questions or comments leave them below we're going to keep following the quest 3 over time and see how it evolves because there's going to be a lot more stuff down the road that's going to be really interesting to check out and make sure to like And subscribe thanks for watching,439.4,621.843,201.51999999999998
CNET,WoChOAscBkQ,VR,Meta,all right earlier this year I got a demo of Apple's future of mixed reality the 3 500 Vision Pro blending the virtual and real together that's coming in 2024 but meta is blending the virtual and real on the quest 3 and it costs just five hundred dollars the metaquest 3 is their new VR headset the update to The Quest 2 which has already been our favorite VR headset for years the new one is coming out October 10th and it costs more 500 for 128 gigabytes of storage and 650 for the one with 512 gigabytes of storage the big thing on this headset is mixed reality there's a whole new chip on board a Qualcomm Snapdragon xr2 Gen 2 and that chip which is going to be seen on other headsets as well is debuting here and that's the big thing it allows besides better graphics and improved performance is this mixed reality which means that you can look at the real world through its improved color cameras see things in the real world and VR objects can be interlaid with it this also has a depth sensor which is something that meta's higher end Quest Pro that debuted last,0.0,621.843,140.939
CNET,WoChOAscBkQ,VR,Meta,year didn't have so you're basically getting a better VR headset than the quest Pro for half the price strange how Tech works but it was nowhere near as good as Apple's Vision Pro then again The Vision Pro is 3 500 and the quest 3 is 500 that's a three thousand dollar price Gap so pretty good for a 500 device there are a couple of different demos that showed really how this functions and the quest 3 looks like it's really focusing on gaming a couple of these experiences worked kind of like I saw in Vision Pro which is that I would scan the room be able to mesh the real world and scan objects recognize the vision of furniture tables and walls and then virtual objects would then interact with it first encounters which is a intro experience on the quest 3 showed how you could shoot things and run around furniture and things would pop out of the walls and the walls would shatter it's a cool effect the camera quality is much better even than the quest Pro and it's much better than the Quest 2 and the quest 3 defaults to showing the outer world as its first experience and then you can jump into,74.4,621.843,130.859
CNET,WoChOAscBkQ,VR,Meta,pure VR as well if you want meta's promising about 100 apps to start a lot of the stuff right now looks like games and special effects are going to spread out of walls I think for Fitness it's going to be really interesting if you could do workouts and still see the regular world around you that could be a lot of fun and actually pretty useful there's also a big thing that's missing on the quest 3 that was on the quest Pro no eye tracking and no face tracking now there'll probably come out a pro version of the quest 3 at some point especially since Qualcomm Snapdragon xr2 Gen 2 chip could support it the headset's smaller it's definitely more compact in the front a lot easier to put on and it's got a extra depth adjuster on it which allows you to accommodate for glasses without having to add a spacer in they worked fine with my chunky glasses but I don't have that wide a pair of glasses they narrowly fit and you're going to have to see how it fits with yours the controllers are new these controllers are smaller they don't have that plastic ring anymore and that means they probably won't break as,139.319,621.843,116.45999999999998
CNET,WoChOAscBkQ,VR,Meta,easily in case you smack it into something but they don't have quite all the features that are on the quest Pros controller they don't have the cameras that were on the touch Pro so they're not fully self-trackable you could always pay to upgrade to those if you want there are also things like an optional charge dock with the quest 3 which is something that the Quest 2 did not have the resolution and the Optics on this are really good there's a pancake lens system which is similar to what's on the quest Pro pancake lines is basically a more compact lens system and it's clearer and the resolution on this display is higher than any of the other Quest headsets and there was no light bleed when I wore the headset so unlike the quest Pro you're going to feel really immersed there are a lot of different accessories for the quest 3 ranging from carrying cases to charge docks and a lot of different headbands and different facial fits including colors this time I'm feeling optimistic that they're going to be a lot more interesting color designs for Quest 3.,198.239,621.843,110.77900000000001
CNET,WoChOAscBkQ,VR,Meta,Graphics well technically they could be really good but the games I got to play so far a handful of the launch titles Assassin's Creed Nexus I got to try somebody Amigo I got to try stranger things um and I also got to look at Red matter too in an upgraded version the graphics you know were incremental so I wouldn't say it's a type of like astonishing jump right now that you would have seen a PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5. that's because this is a little more like a phone or a tablet upgrade there are also more advanced VR headsets out there The Vision Pro is not here yet but it costs a lot to produce an impressive effect and the PlayStation VR 2 has really amazing graphics and some great eye tracking functions but it costs 550 and you still need a PlayStation 5 in order to use it that's a lot of money the quest 3 500 and all self-contained so stay tuned for a lot more thoughts on the quest 3. it's a very promising headset and it's the most mobile and active VR headset so if anybody's looking for Fitness or mobile gaming meaning moving around gaming I feel like this is going to be the top pick anyway if you have more questions or comments let us know below and make sure you keep watching,253.159,621.843,137.30200000000002
CNET,It3Zv-Eh6tg,VR,Meta,Apple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset is finally here after years of rumors leaks and speculations but how does it compare to another high-end headset of recently announced meta Quest 3 and which one should you buy let's break it down Apple unveiled The Vision Pro at this year's WWDC keynote and just days before meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg teased the new Quest 3 on Instagram interesting timing we didn't get a lot of details about the quest 3 but you may now be wondering which device to reach for when they eventually hit store shelves so let's explore what we know so far also just to get this out of the way we are not comparing this to meta's other mixed reality headset the quest Pro instead we're looking at two recently unveiled devices The Vision Pro and the quest 3. first things first the price Apple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset costs a whopping 3 500 meanwhile the quest 3 starts at 500 which for reference is more than the Quest 2 but less than the PlayStation VR too that gives you an idea of who apple and meta are targeting with their respective devices 500 for the quest 3 isn't pocket change but it's,1.82,621.843,137.02
CNET,It3Zv-Eh6tg,VR,Meta,a lot easier to swallow than a 3 500 price tag so it might appeal to more casual or everyday consumers but then again a lot of Apple Fans may be willing to Fork over as much cash as needed to secure the hottest new product the power of Apple now let's look into how these devices work division Pro is controlled by users eyes hands and voice you can browse through apps just by looking at them and then tap your fingers together to select flick your wrist to scroll and use your voice to dictate the idea is to make it feel like digital content is physically there in your space you can turn the digital crown on the side of the headset to control how much of the virtual or physical world you're seeing the quest 3 also Blends physical and Virtual Worlds so you can interact with both simultaneously so you could play a virtual board game on your kitchen table or decorate your home with virtual art according to meta both devices will offer an immersive experience when it comes to watching movies and TV shows and playing video games Apple highlighted being able to watch 3D,70.26,621.843,123.30000000000003
CNET,It3Zv-Eh6tg,VR,Meta,movies with the Vision Pro along with connecting popular game controllers they're around 500 apps and experiences for the Quest 2 and meta's App Store and you can play around 100 Apple arcade games with a standard gaming controller like you would with a TV with Apple TV but so far if you want a more immersive gaming experience you may want to reach for the quest based on the keynote it seems like apple is more focused on extending what you do on your phone or computer into the world around you that could mean watching a TV show looking at photos or browsing through videos and you can't talk about an Apple product without noting the advantage of having the Apple ecosystem at your fingertips literally something else Apple emphasized in its keynote is work collaboration The Vision Pro supports magic keyboard and magic Trackpad so users can essentially set up a workspace through the headset when it comes to Hardware it's a bit of a toss-up a huge Advantage for meta is that this isn't their first rodeo they've been releasing headsets for years so they have more experience and,132.42,621.843,118.619
CNET,It3Zv-Eh6tg,VR,Meta,have gotten a lot more feedback than Apple but Apple's also known for well-designed products so that user experience with the Vision Pro is probably going to be pretty solid renders of the quest 3 show a three strap design to help distribute the weight when you wear it and metas controllers are also known for being lightweight and ergonomic The Vision Pro has a two-sided strap with a wide pad in the back to hold your head and there's also an option to add a third strap like with the quest 3. the key difference here is that there are no controllers with the Vision Pro since it relies entirely on eye tracking hand gestures and voice control but Apple did show it being used with the wireless PS5 controller for gaming ultimately both devices are relatively lightweight which is of course important if you're strapping it to your head the quest 3 is 40 thinner than its predecessor and the vision Pro's glass front and aluminum frame also make it pretty thin and light meta says the quest 3 has double the GPU processing power than the Quest 2 and higher,191.879,621.843,114.17999999999999

CNET,shJoeddRkUM,VR,Meta,meta's got a brand new VR headset just days before Apple announces theirs the metaquest 3. here's what we know Mark Zuckerberg teased the metaquest 3 in the middle of a special Instagram post right in the middle of the day that we already had a bunch of VR games that were launching for the quest the quest 3 was already known about this was announced last year and it's an update to The Quest 2 which is a VR headset that launched a couple of years ago and has been the best VR headset around although that VR headset is starting to feel a little bit old you definitely want to wait for the quest 3 based on what we've heard the quest 3 now has a price it's 500 which is more expensive than the Quest 2 which was 400 or used to be 400 because the Quest 2 is now getting a price drop that's going to be going back down to 300 which was the original price of a Quest 2 when it launched but the quest 3 has a number of new features,0.0,621.843,100.56
CNET,shJoeddRkUM,VR,Meta,that look like they're going to be worth it first of all it's going to be smaller it's meant to be significantly lighter and more compact in the front than the quest 2. that should make it easier to wear air for longer periods of time there are also brand new controllers now if you've ever seen the quest Pro headset that came out last year which had more compact controllers these have that similar type of look without that big plastic ring and so they should be easier to pack away when you're traveling and they also are promising better haptics which is the vibrational feedback this also has a brand new processor Qualcomm has a new update to its xr2 check that's supposed to provide faster performance better graphics that is something I'm really curious about trying also because of the fact that this is aiming towards a future where we're all going to be wearing AR headsets maybe that allow us to look at,50.82,621.843,90.30000000000003
CNET,shJoeddRkUM,VR,Meta,the world and overlay things this has mixed reality capabilities now that means better color cameras that are on this headset plus a depth sensor and so it means that this should be able to take VR and overlay it with video pass-through of what you see in the real world this type of mixed reality has already been out there The Quest 2 does some of it already and the quest Pro does it better also there's the Vive XR Elite that came out earlier this year and Apple's headset is supposed to be doing a whole lot of this but it could position the quest 3 as a really interesting low-cost mixed reality headset one thing that it's lacking from the quest Pro is eye tracking now the PlayStation VR2 does have eye tracking it's used mainly for improving Graphics to allow the PlayStation 5 to push more stuff into your eyes to make it look cooler Apple's headset is supposed to have eye tracking as well leaving out,95.82,621.843,100.49999999999999
CNET,shJoeddRkUM,VR,Meta,eye tracking on a 500 headset that's probably expected The Meta Quest 3 is also going to run all the games and apps that are on the quest too that's similar to the way the Quest 2 worked with the quest but it does open the door potentially for a number of exclusives down the road The Quest 2 started to run games that were more optimized for it and the quests started to slowly disappear it does feel like that's going to be the Destiny for what the Quest 2 is going to have at some point although the Quest 2 could be set up as a really nice affordable alternative for the next year or so the quest 3 is not supposed to launch until the fall Mark Zuckerberg indicated that it's going to be announced at meta's connect conference for developers September 27th so I suggests a similar launch time to other Quest headsets in the past and it could line up with when Apple's headset comes out which we still don't really know all,145.86,621.843,87.29899999999999
CNET,shJoeddRkUM,VR,Meta,that much about at the time that I recorded this but there are a number of VR headsets on the market at the moment including the PlayStation VR2 which we love although it does require a PlayStation 5 to use it the one advantage to the quest 3 is it's going to be completely self-contained and at that price at 500 it could actually compete as a gaming console which is where meta has had Success With The Quest already now there have been a lot of experiments into fitness and work and to other applications for meta but it looks like meta is leaning even more on gaming now especially up against apple and its more ambitious headset so the metaquest 3 could be one of the Best Buys in VR this year but of course the year is only about halfway through we'll know more when we get a chance to see it more and maybe finally demo it if you have any more questions please leave them down below and make sure to like And subscribe thanks a lot,190.019,621.843,100.23900000000002
