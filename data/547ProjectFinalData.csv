The difference is incredible and it's reassuring to hear that this was a good upgrade year haha. The camera is genuinely mind-blowing and that ending was brilliant.

Really happy with the Natural Titanium color, new cameras and USB C (I can charge my phone and laptop with the same cable!). However I keep the default focal length to 28mm (1.2x), because I like taking pictures of my food and the new main camera seems to have a slightly farther focal distance than my iPhone 12. So 1.2x forces me to hold the phone slightly farther away from my subject so that it is properly in focus 

(I tend to avoid macro mode cause the photos from the main camera is still much better than the wide angle used in macro mode)",2024-01-01T13:37:36Z,5

USBC is great, especially because my iPad Air, Beats earbuds, Mac, and Switch all use it. The screen’s a massive upgrade too. I have twice the storage on here. The dynamic island is cool too. At first I thought it was just a little gimmick, but it’s genuinely useful to be able to pause media, skip songs, stop timers, etc. without having to leave whatever app I have open.

It cannot be that expensive when most smart phones target 120hz now anyways. The only reason it's still 60hz is because of what Marques said; it is a way to differentiate the regular 15 from the 15 pro. And that's a shame. They are purposely making their base phones worse.,2023-10-03T01:48:09Z,4706

I’m coming from an 11 Pro Max that I’ve had since it came out. Everything you said and your main point overall is extremely spot on. I think people have oversight at times on trying to justify buying a new phone each year but that was never really practical anyway. Truth is when I get an Apple product it’s an investment and something I plan to keep for a 3-4 year period. My point is coming from and 11 pro max this 15 feels light years ahead. From the smaller “notch” to the overall “feel” IFYKYK,2023-10-28T23:14:08Z,58

Been an Apple guy for 15 years now, but the only thing stopping me from switching now is the cost of switching & iOS/MacOS. I don’t see the added value anymore from the device.",2023-09-20T05:34:42Z,106

As I'm rocking an iPhone 13 Pro Max right now, I'm not really inclined to upgrade. 
The main reasons for me personally would be upholding the ""value"" by uptrading as currently the 13 Pro Max is still worth a good amount of money.
And the other reason is the camera. 
Sure USB-C is nice and all, but it also means, as you mentioned, that all my accessories are pretty much useless now or I need to buy adapters. 
With no faster charging mentioned it also doesn't make a big difference anyway. The faster data transfer speeds aside. 
So yeah, again, mixed feelings and will only upgrade if I get a good offer through my mobile provider.",2023-09-23T10:01:46Z,10

- the 5x telephoto (3x seems to work fine for me as I never really needed to zoom any further than that)
- usb C port
- screen brightness
- chip which probably isn’t even noticeably faster
- Titanium build
Probably more of a difference than the 13 pro to 14 pro had (from what a lot of people said wasn’t much at all), but still not justified imo. Great video btw.",2023-09-25T09:12:51Z,13

My charge case is basically now useless as the phone loses charge so fast now that its draining faster than the case can deliver. If I restart my phone however it returns to normal and they begin charging at similar rates, really annoying and I hope they fix, was hoping to upgrade to the 14 but will see my other options if this doesn't get fixed soon. I'd normally just put this down to battery wear and tear however this only started after updating to IOS 16 and once I restart it its normal again.

During the launch day everyone, and I mean, EVERYONE who asked about the 14 wanted only a Pro and no-one asked anything about the 14 and 14 Plus.
Spec by spec (minus the 48mpix wide camera and slightly better battery) it's a 13. 
When there was 13 against 12 we had some clear differences, but this phone is essentially just shooting itself in it's foot considering that the 13 is still under production.
My theory is that Apple received way too many A15 chips after the backlog cleared from the pandemic and normalized and they had no idea what else to do than make a phone with those chips, slightly make it better and slap an extra number on top.",2022-09-17T07:09:19Z,2206

I had the Pixel 6 pro right when it came out, and I returned it within a week due to all of the issues. I was impressed with the phone and really wanted to keep it, but it was plagued with issues- especially the fingerprint scanner almost never worked even after registering the same finger multiple times. I think the optical fingerprint scanner is an issue especially during colder weather. I received my Pixel 6 pro in December. I believe the colder weather, lower humidity, lower skin hydration makes the optical sensor struggle. I find that the ultrasonic on the S21 worked better than the Pixel optical scanner in all scenarios, but also noticed that when my skin was more hydrated (warmer weather) it worked better. I also tested my theory this past winter by applying lotion at times and noticed the scanner would work better. This may explain why some people had less issues with the Pixel 6 fingerprint scanner based on time of year and location (weather). I think adding the facial recognition helps the Pixel 7, but really the Samsung ultrasonic sensor is better and also include facial recognition. Personally I feel if they brought back the capacitive sensors and placed it on the back of the phone- I would prefer those- they worked perfectly all the time.  The Pixel is the more innovative, but the Samsung more practical and dependable. Also for me the 10X optical lens in the S21 is preferred since I do a lot of video and photography of my daughter performances at a distance. Thanks again for a great review!",2023-02-05T17:06:40Z,24

My warranty was expiring on my 4a (which I was perfectly happy with) and they had a deal for a trade in and some pixel buds so at the end of the day it was only like 50 bucks for the 6a.  I was just expecting a replacement for the 4a but this feels like a major upgrade.  All the features and build feels like it should cost 100 bucks more, easily.

There's only two things I'd change; I can get used to the bar on the back, but I really preferred the front camera in the corner on the 4a.  The glass body, taller screen, front facing fingerprint reader...love all of those features.    Wireless charging doesn't effect me cuz I use these little USB magnetic charging dongle things on all of my devices.

But reading the comments, it seems like 60hz disappoints a lot of people.  The 6a feels perfectly smooth to me.  I'm not always on my phone and I've never owned a flagship so I might not know any better, but I DO care about refresh rates on monitors and can tell the difference.  For the price difference in premium phones to the 6a you could buy a friggin television with 120hz.  Is that one feature really worth it?  To each there own, I suppose.",2022-08-05T15:41:30Z,59

The description you gave of the real strengths to the Tensor is one of the best I have seen, and you do understand about photography and make pertinent comparisons, which is not too common with other reviewers and reviews sites.Your list of drawbacks is also very good, and these are things which will matter in actual use. Particularly the battery life, if there is anything keeping me from getting the Pixel 6 is that.
If I may add a few problems which are not often mentioned but can be a deal breaker for some:
1) Google deliberately prevents their phones, including the Pixel 6, to stream video and audio to HDMI via a dongle. This is because they want users to use their chromecast instead. But this is limiting. Latency over chromecast (wifi essentially) is high. So one cannot for instance run a steam link on the phone to stream games to a projector over LAN, because latency will cause problems. Similarly, someone simply wanting to display a presentation or other material via hdmi will be unable to.
Admittedly not a lot of people will need that. But if they do, finding up that their expensive tech marvel cannot do what a few hundreds bucks phone can, and knowing that it is a deliberate choice from Google.. Well, it leaves a bit of bitter aftertaste.
2) Google implementation of audio streaming prevents some dongles and devices to receive audio. For instance your average wired phone adapter on amazon or similar will not work with this Pixel. It is possible to find compatible adapters and they are not too expensive. But the problem will affect high end DAC too, external audio interfaces which musicians might like to use on the go, and similar.
Again, not necessarily a common scenario, but finding out that your high tech phone is designed so to prevent you from doing these basic things which any cheap handset can do.. It does not feel so good.",2022-07-18T17:12:57Z,7

Just upgraded from S10 to S22 only because of delayed patches on S10 and nearing EOS. On the vibration issue, I guess Samsung took a note of feedback and provided a vibration sound setting to alleviate the issue out of pocket at-least. Couldn't agree more to all things mentioned about Samsung maturing from bloatware over the years and now leading the way in Android features. I myself was OnePlus fan before moving to S10 which was a pleasant surprise and S22 has bettered it in terms of some cool nifty features in software like ""video call effects"".  Having ""Switch""-ed over my data from old phone, I will soon be missing the expandable storage I guess. Limiting battery charge to 85% is another cool feature to prolong battery life which makes sense as Samsung promised 4 years of software support.

Marques,  love to hear your thoughts on likelihood of transition from multi lensed phones to a mount with larger sensor design.  Say a 1 inch sensor with a G-mount / iMount and 'kit' 35mm equivalent, then add on lenses, maybe stored in the body somehow or more likely a first party case.   Maybe kind of niche but could be a great differentiator for the top end Ultra / Folds etc.  What do you think?

I'd be surprised if the body material played a huge role between the Stainless Steel 14 Pro and the Titanium 15 Pro.  Aluminium has a thermal conductivity of around 236 W/m/K vs ca 14.3 for stainless steel and 22.4 for Titanium.  The stainless steel will therefore conduct heat at the slowest rate of the 3 materials used.  I think it has a lot more to do with the way the computing power is used as well as the heat transfer area of the larger phones.,2023-10-06T07:34:09Z,85

Yes, it’s heating up only at the magnetic charging part And it takes maybe about over 3 to 4 hours to have a full battery charge without using the phone too much. Me personally I have not experienced any overheating issues maybe because the protective case that I have my OtterBox and are usually don’t use high definition stuff like that just the basic essentials of texting looking at videos a couple, Luke camera pictures here and there nothing too extreme or over-the-top. Just like you said, there are a lot of variables that these phones may overheat, and the software issue could be a possibility.

With that being said android offers more value like multi tasking , stylus pen w gestures, foldable innovation,  advanced emulation no limitations etc. This is exactly why Samsung, Google,  Huawei and Xiaomi , One plus and Red Magic and the entire android family will always be lightyears ahead of ios and why I will never return my main sim to ios ever again.",2024-01-19T10:30:56Z,9

I keep on asking myself if there’s anything I honestly miss my old Google pixel phones – not as much as I thought it would be. I realize that Google still doesn’t understand dark mode to save their life even on iOS apps versus dark grey mode. But I can say I don’t missed my pixels too much from my pixels. When I had my Google pixels, android auto was horrible for me. CarPlay is fantastic. I’ve never actually had an issue using Siri and I tweaked optimize everything on my 13 Pro max for how are use it. 😊

1. fingerprint sensor, unreliable, blinding at night.
2. No folders in app drawer
3. No HDMI video output or Desktop mode.
4. Face unlock is slower than using fingerprint. 
5. Non customizable power button, will not work as flashlight
6. Can't stack widgets 
7. Quick back-tap gesture, unreliable, inconsistent. 
8. Selfie camera looks weird, cannot change over-sharpenning, over-contrasting
9. Rear camera No HDR @ 60fps
10. No scrolling screenshots. 
11. Cannot further customize power button + volume rocker combinations for multiple actions. 
12. No customizable widgets, cannot change opacity or size. 
13. Cannot remove or change at a glance widget.
14. Cannot remove or change Google search widget.
15. AI photo editing does not give full options all the time. Sometimes offers STYLIZED editing, sometimes BEST SHOT, sometimes none. 
16. Cannot use HOME ONLY without drawer on native launcher, have to use third party. 

PROS for keeping the Pixel 8 Pro vs S24 Ultra:
1. Assistant works with WhatsApp. 
2. Assistant call handling, spam screening, hold for call, navigate call menus visually. 
3. Assistant works with phone locked.
4. No forced bloatware apps, Samsung internet, Samsung pass, Samsung health, 
5. Big FLAT display screen, bright and vibrant colors, responsive. 
6. Relatively good price. 
7. Easy to hold, light, feels sturdy. 
8. Glass back feels premium and hides fingerprints.
9. Photo Magic eraser, audio eraser seem to work fine.",2023-10-14T13:33:48Z,2

The Exynos modems for the Pixel 6 and 7 had major network issues. Had a Pixel 6 dozens of times a day no signal at all up to 20 minutes at a time on both ATT and T-Mobile even in populated cities around DFW. Same sim cards in a $50 UMX phone didn't have those issues. Got it RMA'ed same exact issue with a different Pixel 6 device inspected. Others had 3+ RMA's and just ended up giving up selling the phone for a loss or traded it in which is what I had to do too. Google only offers to keep doing RMA's. Every review for every phone should do signal DBM comparisons and other tests that are the main point of a phone.,2023-10-16T05:42:40Z,3

Thermometers aren’t usually in pocket like your phone is; it could be nice in case your child starts feeling under the weather while you’re out somewhere.

Hopefully this is well-received and we can start getting more little features (fingers crossed for IR blaster).

I love the flat screen on the Pixels. They, in my opinion, look a lot better than curved. And this is coming from someone who was once a curved screen truther. I always felt the Pixel 6 and 7 were too slick because of the curved screen, and screen protectors were a pain to install.

Overall, aesthetically, I think this looks like the best Pixel to date. Now, we still gotta see how it works in the hands of consumers, given the Tensor chip’s sometimes wonky performance, with overheating, modem issues etc. Hopefully G3 performs a lot better. I’ll definitely be interested in getting a 8 Pro.",2023-10-04T19:23:33Z,9

Like everyone does when they get a new phone, I played a lot with it in the beginning and was worried the battery life wasn't that great but now that I've settled in to a more normal usage it seems to have gotten better and I have no problems getting a full day out of it and actually almost two days. I love the screen and 90Hz refresh rate. Coming from a 720p LCD to this is amazing. It may not be as bright as some OLED's but it's fine for my uses. I specifically bought this one for the camera and it's just amazing. It does everything I want. A few things I've noticed that I'm not too fond of is how it takes three touches to connect to WiFi and disconnect. It should be two like most phones. Also, I find it fussy when pressing an icon. Any small movement in that press and instead of opening the app it wants to move the icon. Maybe I""m doing something wrong or I'm just too shaky? I use it for work to record items for later distribution and printing and it's been great for that. I use Android File Transfer but in this phone to use that I have to have the connection in debugging mode. I hope they fix that eventually. I'm one of those that can't imagine myself walking around with a thousand dollar phone (actually $2000 here in Canada) and this one at $600 was the best I could get for the money at the time. Comparing the price to discounted phone isn't really fair since all phones eventually get discounted. Like you said with a new phone you get a little more updates than the discounted ones. The biggest problem is the heat when wireless charging. I think it might hurt the battery longevity so I use it sparingly when I just need a little top off to be safe. And it should be mentioned that there is a repair kit available for it now that includes all the tools and parts you'll need to fix it yourself should the need arise prematurely.

I can easily see the 7a being a great choice for so many people due to it's smaller dimensions though.  And it seems that you aren't really giving up anything important.

I do take issue with your complaint about screen brightness, however.  EVERY phone has to be at maximum brightness to be useable outside on a sunny day, this is not unique to the Pixel 7a.  Just use the autobrightness feature which will do this for you.  When you are outdoors, brighter is always better and the Pixels do not have the brightest screens - Apple and Samsung screens are a bit brighter.",2023-08-28T15:49:42Z,5

I go on a lot of walks with my camera and take pictures of birds, and often have my Airpods in listening to music, but use transparency mode to listen for birds. On the previous generation, it was often difficult to pinpoint exactly where a bird was. It was more a general direction, like to the left or right of me, but pinpointing a specific direction or height was difficult. First walk with the new ones and I was hearing the birds so clearly and coming from such a specific direction that I couldn't initially tell if it was coming from the song I was listening to or not. I heard a bird from directly above me and looked up just in time to see a bird flying directly overhead, exactly where I heard the sound come from. I could easily hear the footsteps of people coming up from behind me on the walking path too.

I tried the adaptive transparency mode today because we were working near a loud water pump and holy that thing really works well! I can see myself using this feature a lot for my work specially as I work around other team mates and want to be able to hear them but still cut out the loud horn or bell noise whenever we have to ring them which are sometimes over 85 decibels and can be painful to hear when its too loud.

Thankfully with the Gen 3 that isnt an issue anymore although I would like to see more companies have more options for different people.

The biggest dealbreaker for me and other friends is that when you run, you can’t just quickly hit your ear to skip next track. You have to either use watch or Siri (which is kinda okay, but not always convenient).  I hope they will bring this feature back in gen4

Also, when using these for calls, you hear your own voice too much (that’s why I don’t want to buy pro, but thought that gen3 would have the same feel as gen2, where everything is fine).

I bought them, but will probably give them away because of these drawbacks",2021-12-23T23:45:53Z,34

I'm currently watching reviews because I have 80% made up my mind to buy them v soon and I prefer hard-tips (not for long hours of use perhaps) over silicon ones because they don't give off that 'suffocating' feeling inside my ears and also I can still hear ambient sounds when outside without really being too anxious.

I’m currently an Airpods Max owner who previously owned Sony xm4 and Bose NC 700 for a couple of days. If you want to use headphones just at home and to be free from any annoying noises, and you’re already in the Apple ecosystem, and you like to watch Dolby Atmos movies often, you won’t regret buying Airpods Max. Their ANC performance is marginally better than that of any of Sony and Bose headphones according to a measurement performed by a Korean YouTuber called “0DiBi”. Also, another great thing about Airpods Max is their white noise level in background with no music playing is way lower than Sony’s and Bose’s. That said, if you want some headphones you like to use mostly when travelling, go get some lighter, cheaper ones like just normal Airpods or cans from Sony or Bose or whatever. Personally I couldn’t keep wearing either Sony xm4 or Bose NC 700 more than an hour due to discomfort issues with both of them, whereas I find wearing Airpods Max for several hours very comfortable despite their relatively heavyweight. Their innovative canopy headband and mesh cushions really work for me.",2022-02-16T20:16:53Z,150

What I mean by that is that most people just compare the sound quality and how comfortable the headphones are; but a lot of people might buy it bcuz of the look, or because of what the headphones are trying to do (ex. better durability). A lot of time they're just like ""these headphones have better sound quality so dont buy the other ones"" and only pay little attention to everything else.",2022-09-19T23:30:36Z,8

I love using these for at home. I just still prefer using my Pros when I’m working or outside. Apple should’ve released these with a better case. There’s no way of getting around that. Not having a off button really doesn’t bother me that much though. The battery holds surprisingly well when it’s in the case. I’ll probably end up buying a third party case for these for road trips. The weight doesn’t bother me much. I have a thick neck and a wide head so not much of an issues, lol.",2021-07-15T00:10:01Z,136

I think this really speaks to how good these headphones are.  It's crazy that a couple years later, these are still apparently the best wireless headphones, at least for Apple users.  The people who work in the studio, especially Marques, could use ANY pair of headphones they want, and yet they choose the Airpods Max over all the other available headphones.  The mix of convenience and sound quality seems like it's unrivaled, although I wish they did fix that case issue.",2023-01-13T02:30:11Z,71

Sadly, I lost them somehow while on vacation. When I bit the bullet for the Airpods after my friend raved about them for weeks, I finally got what he was on about. The occasional connection problem that made me need to turn bluetooth on and off, the occasional sync problem between left and right... all of that was gone. Those were just minor annoyances that never *really* bothered me, and I still would be perfectly happy with my Ankers, but I do get the appeal of these things. 



Noise-canceling works better than I thought it would. The sound quality is satisfying. They sound ""bigger"" that you would expect. It is not audiophile stuff by any means, but I don't think most people even want that. They're great for podcasts, audiobooks, and casual music listening. They really stick great in my ears, better than any other earbud I've ever used. The tips aren't round, they're oval. It's a subtle difference that is effective. They are expensive. I picked them up for $199 at a sale, which is the most I'd be willing to pay for them. That's still quite a bit of money, so if you don't want to spend this much, look at what Anker has to offer. Their stuff is great, too.",2021-08-03T19:59:40Z,18

I'm using the Creative Outlier Pro's and Galaxy Buds+ right now because they both ACTUALLY give the 10+ hour battery life they're rated for, although neither sound particularly good. The Outlier Pro's actually sound almost bad stock but after some heavy EQ they're fine. Also they can reproduce wild amounts of sub-bass (when desired) with basically zero distortion which I love.

To fix it, when sound is playing use the volume slider to lower the volume to 0% and then raise it to 100%. You should see that it's noticeably louder.

More powerful driver, more impedance, and usually this means it requires more power to drive (lower sensitivity). But this is actually a good thing with bluetooth buds. Often times, in order to conserve space, they opt for a smaller, less demanding driver (usually 6 mm or so) which is usually much more sensitive since it requires less power from the amp. This is why on more budget earbuds you get a lot of hiss when there is no playback, because the noisefloor is raised due to the heightened sensitivity (low impedance) and also because cheaper dacs/amps are being used.",2022-10-31T17:37:26Z,16

- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).
- Plenty of ""thump"" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix. You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage. Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).
- Little bit ""dark"" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.
- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular. It's only got a single 30mm driver per ear, so that one driver is covering EVERYTHING from 20Hz to 40kHz. As such, it's expected that imaging won't be super detailed, so no surprise there. I was really hoping to see at least 2 drivers per ear. By contrast, my CCA C12 in-ear-monitors (IEM's) that I use when playing on stage are about $50 and have 6 drivers PER EAR each playing a different frequency range. Needless to say, the imaging, and extension on those IEM's is a LOT better than these headphones that cost 7x the price. Due to their small form factor, IEM's can use armature drivers where 'can' style headphones like this can't use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.
- Minimal, but still present, ""pressure"" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing. Having a set of ANC headphones with ""pressure"" that grabs my attention is an absolute deal-breaker for me regardless of price point.

Overall, these are going to be my go-to headphone for the office. They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.",2023-02-20T07:17:44Z,21

I like them more each day. The light weight, the comfort, the very good noise canceling, the way I can have it paired to my laptop and my phone simultaneously and it'll switch back and forth on the fly depending on which device is outputting sound to it (fairly useful during the workday).

But know the best part? The touch to the side to place it into transparency mode and how it immediately returns to noise canceling once you remove your hand. Extremely useful when you work from home and the kids get home from school. Runner up is how it can be set to automatically go into transparency mode when it detects you beginning to talk. Also useful for the same scenario.

Especially having a headphone that pauses or lowers volume of music when conversations begin. Taking out my phone and attempting to hit pause or trying to figure out which rocker is the volume can be frustrating. The noise cancling  is super important with anxiety which a lot of blind individuals experience due to all the noises around us. So having better ambient noise filtration helps with dangerous situations like crossing streets.,2022-04-13T09:15:55Z,289

I think it turns it from a gimmick to a much more useful feature than the palm thing. Now you can just activate it with a gesture when you know you might be talking to people and deactivate it right after so you don't have to worry about it going off. Honestly haven't tried in practice yet though.,2020-12-23T09:46:58Z,189

I use them everyday at work while I micro-finish parts. Completely gets rid of all the ambient noise in a machine shop. I have so many hours on these its crazy. All ive had to replace was the ear-pads because they were starting to fall apart and de-laminate.

I bought a pair of these, specifically because of this video, and yup, they're now my go-to as well.  Excellent sound, excellent signal quality and range.  They just work.  Best part for me is the fit.  I'm looking at a small pile of earbuds from various manufacturers sitting on a nearby shelf as evidence of the hunt that I've been on for a great pair.  Since I've had these in hand, the longest day I've had wearing them was 13 hours while I was writing and drawing.  They remain comfortable, no sore spots, no hot spots.  This includes one day when I was outdoors in 90 degree heat working for a couple of hours.

Build quality: 7.5/10, no creaks & quite durable, but a lot of glass filled nylon AKA plastic.
Comfort: 9.5/10, great padding, light weight, low clamping force, flexible. Best in the market.
Features: 7/10, has all the basic features you would need for casual listening, but less customization than the competition.
Sound: 8/10, Flat sound signature, highs and mids shine, but has poor sound stage and a neutral bass.
ANC: 9/10, one of the best in the market, however there's a slight 'airplane cabin pressure' feel to it.
Battery: 9/10, Excellent at 20hrs with ANC on
Connectivity: 7/10, Decent with ~10m obstructed & 35m direct line of sight.

Bottom line: 8/10. Great wireless, ANC headphones for commuting. Fantastic ANC and comfort, good sound reproduction. However it does lack a wide variety of features/customization options compared to the competition, and neutral bass may sound ""boring"" to some.",2017-07-23T05:44:26Z,49

On the other hand using the airpods 3 doesnt feel immersive when I want to listen to music or watch a movie and you can still hear noise.

The 3’s are more comfortable because it doesn’t feel like your ears are plugged.  Transparency mode is good on the pros but still sounds artificial (amplified) sometimes where the 3’s the environment around you still sounds very natural almost like your not wearing ear buds.,2021-11-23T09:08:15Z,114

AirPods Pro definitely have better audio quality and I love the noise cancellation, but they’re surprisingly less stable in my ears when I’m exercising or being active because the silicone tips slide in my ear canals and also make the body stick out of my ear more than the 3rd Gen. Also, the silicone tips can be uncomfortable when laying down and can make my ears itch after long periods of use.

I couldn’t agree more! I was watching some really old unbox therapy videos the other day. So much more personality from Lew and the rest of the team, so much more fun, so much more fun with the demonstrations too. 

Now most videos just consist of boring sponsorships, no personality from Lew at all, rarely see any kind of interactions with anyone else in the studio. It feels like they’re just advertising products without really doing anything. It just feels all super rushed. 

At the end of the day they made it, they’re a huge channel, made tons of money and now they’ve made it they’ve got complacent sadly. I doubt it will change anytime soon.",2023-12-08T21:01:23Z,776

When I actually had them in my hands and I compared them to my XM4s they simply didn't have the richness in bass. When you boost the bass in EQ, especially on heavier bass/edm songs the volume is reduced significantly. Mids and highs are impressive, but for my music taste they just didn't make the cut.

-Them not being noise canceling isn't a 'flaw' its a choice. I have Jaybird Bluebuds which are great but when I need to hear the outside world like at work, I bought Airpods for that reason. If you are supposed to speak to them for assistant, or have a conversation with Google Translate, then you don't want noise cancellation. For those reasons, and the fact that the Airpods are also not noise canceling, I don't think thats a good reason.
-Listing the cable connecting them as a 'flaw' is another choice by them. Tons of people prefer that over completely wireless, cause they think you won't lose one. I dont mind either way, like I said, I have one of each. But thats not a flaw its a choice.
-They are both wireless, both not noise canceling, both have a charging case with the same battery, both have good UI for connecting to their respective phones, both talk to their voice assistant, Google can do translate. I really don't see how they are not the same, and perfectly recommendable.
The biggest 'flaw' I saw here was with Google Translate, and thats about the translate app not the earbuds. And Google Translate is fantastic. It has tons of languages as you said, but you have to realize what you're saying and how you'd actually use it. If you need to navigate and get by in another country, the vocabulary you'd use would work perfectly well. If you start dropping expressions, colloquialisms, complex sentences that you can guess won't directly translate, then yeah it starts to falter, but thats not how it will usually be used, it still gets the point across most of the time, and it doesn't REALLY have to do with the earbuds, other than its a selling point, but probably not the main one, and definitely not the most used feature.

I mean the Pixel Buds are earphones! Sound quality is literally the most important thing about them. 

Oh and totally wireless is soooo impractical! When you use earphones like the Pixel Buds and have to talk to someone or something like that (or cross the street etc.) you can just remove one or both of them and let them hang around your neck with the totally wireless option you then have one or two earphones in your hand with no where to put them.

They are a device that’s by nature designed to have have the device removed from the case, following the case being put away such as back in the users pocket or bag. Adding a screen would be redundant as the design uses the mobile/computer display itself to control the AirPods as they are companion to those devices. Besides, the AirPods Max would not be able to receive this function, which would cause Apple to confuse users on what devices are better, which is also against Apples design philosophy.

They are very similar in performance, and both sound great. I possibly prefer the sound of the Airpods a little bit due to the quicker transient response of the bass. It just sounds a little bit tighter and punchier, but the Bose bass is deep and rich. You can't go wrong with either of them. The transparency mode and ANC are very close, but there's maybe a slight hiss that remains with the Bose when no music is playing, which I find annoying. I often use ANC for total silence for sleep. Airpods are far more comfortable with side sleeping too. Bose sticks out too far from your ears and they hurt a little bit. They also start flexing the driver in your ear if the mics are muffled by a pillow, so it sounds like a rhythmic thumping. However, I am an Android user and Bose is the clear winner if you use that platform. The wings also make it very secure in my ear, while Airpods tend to slip out. If not trying to sleep on your side, and just listening to audio, both products are equally comfortable to me and well designed. Bose will work better for those, including myself, who have larger ear canals. I tend to get a better seal with them. I like the charging case better for Airpods. It's better built and feels more solid. It's also smaller and charges wirelessly. I hate that the Bose for $300 doesn't charge wirelessly! But, if you are iOS, get Airpods Pro 2. If you are Android, get the Bose QC Buds II. But try to find them on sale.",2023-06-01T15:45:28Z,32

Would be easy to test by riding a bike at around 25 km/h speed.

I'm sort of glad I held out so long because these truly hit all the necessary points for me. I've had a little bit of quirkiness when switching between devices (which I rarely do), but that might have been fixed with the latest firmware. 

Shout out to the white noise / background noise option. I love to listen to white noise...and usually had to have YT going on one of those ambient noise channels. This makes it a million times easier. 

Lastly, and I only found this after viewing a ton of YT reviews of APP2, was the custom audio setup sort of hidden within the accessibility menu. Initially, I had thought music was projecting too much background instrumental sounds over the forefront sounds; i.e. background drums during a guitar solo felt almost as prevalent as the guitar solo. When you go into your iphone settings - Accessibility - AirPods - Audio Accessibility Settings - Headphone Accommodations - On - Custom Audio Setup - This will take you through a bunch of audio tests to determine what you like the best. I don't have the best of hearing after many years of loud cars, concerts and dumb devices that didn't tell you that what you were listening to was too loud. After the test, it determined a different setting was better for me and now music sounds much better to me. I'm really surprised more people haven't mentioned this in their reviews...it's really a hidden gem. 

Also, there also adjustability on the transparency mode setting within the same Custom Audio Setup menu. While it doesn't automatically pick it for you, you can control the levels of amplification and ambient noise reduction. Once again, surprised more reviews haven't mentioned this. 

There could probably be a whole video which goes over the available custom audio settings available!",2022-11-28T02:15:25Z,22

I've never been completely pleased with how the XM3 fit and now that its headband adjustment slider is developing more play and showing its wear and age more, this now feels that I'm about due for a new headset.

But now that the QC Ultra is live I may have to give Bose another try. I'm not liking its usage implications regarding the shorter battery life of the QC Ultra however; I've gotten used to how infrequently I recharge the XM3 and the XM5 is supposed to be more of the same. However what drove me to choosing Sony over Bose in the first place was how much better I thought the top Sony NC/BT headphone at the time (XM2) sounded better than the then-contemporary Bose units. And with you now (perhaps) giving the sonic nod to this new Bose unit, I could be convinced that it's now the time to jump ship, although I still kind of want to wait and see what Sony has up its sleeve. The XM5 has been out for a bit now and one might draw the conclusion that a XM6 generation should be out fairly soon.",2023-10-18T07:10:44Z,13

There is a wind reduction feature, but for whatever reason it is only available in the over-the-ears and not the new earbuds. This would have been an instant upgrade from the QC II earbuds if they included wind reduction, for me.

I hope the apt-x improvements available in the new ultra earbuds will still make it into the QC II's like Bose mentioned earlier in the year.

I'm also curious if they'll improve the sound quality of the over-the-ears to become more similar to the QC II earbuds. The 700's have a weak sound signature compared to the buds - nearly no sub bass, and overall dark and peaky treble.

The reason is because the built in circuit sounds like it is performing at it's limits after the last few updates.

When listening via a headphone amp (for these, its a 50 dollar tube amp and a Schiit modi 2), these headphones come into their own big time.

At first the buds pro were a bit uncomfortable but my ears adjusted to this, but I often have to re-adjust them when using them, the fit was always ""ok"" but never perfect . With the buds2 pro I dont have this problem anymore, as you said the biggest upgrade is the fit. It feels very secure and because of this the sound also sounds better produced, with a tighter seal. The ANC is much better compared to the old buds pro in my opinion but I havent had too much time to test these out properly just yet.

I have not used any of the previous buds, I only have the Sony WH1000XM5 to compare with. Soundwise, these buds surprised me more than I thought. Activating the 360 sound made pretty much everything I listened to feel really immersive. I tried the head detection and it works, but I turned it off as for listening to music I didn't consider it ideal. After listening with 360 turned on for a while, once I turned it off the sound quality felt quite flat; but it also depends on the music I was listening, although it does improve also in how loud I hear, especially vocals. 
I believe it is giving me Hi-Res, I listened to the same song in MP3 and FLAC and the difference was there. From CD quality to Hi-Res the difference is almost imperceptible. I have to say, though, even MP3s sounded wide and clean with 360 turned on, it was just not as clear as uncompressed audio.
Compared to the XM5 I believe the buds sound better, but don't get as loud. Noice cancelling is a win for the XM5, but that might just be because I am comparing buds vs cans.
The buds sound awesome to the point I considering sending back the XM5s (I got them a little while ago), but I am going to keep it because the 30 hours of battery feel endless and the buds do not stream at 24-bit from my PC where my XM5s do  when wired with a portable DAC and then they sound completely different, a lot better. 
Definitely awesome buds for Samsung Smartphone owners especially.",2022-08-24T13:36:48Z,18

More of 6-7 unless you're going all out the whole 5hrs. Overall I'm happy with the promos provided by Samsung on these. Trading in the G1 buds for 75$ off. On top of another 15$ or so for Military. Around 150 for me with tax. Having these will move my 2nd favorite, the Lives, to work as my work buds.

XM4!  Prices for the 5 in the EU are around 440 euro’s while the XM4 can now be bought for around 230/240 euro’s.  So 200 euro’s less for almost the same product. And the major advantage of the XM4 is its portability because of the fact you can swiffel the earphones.  This also makes it easier to wear around your neck.   

I feel in recent years this has been a trend with many new products. The previous products already have so much quality but often a much lower price. For me a great example is the Samsung galaxy series. From the S20 onwards the changes are incremental and for me not worth the additional cost.

I was very disappointed with call quality to the point I can’t use them in my daily environments for calls. They are hopeless in wind on my way to my ferry and absolutely useless on the ferry, so much so I have to bring the headphones that came with my iPhone or people complain when I am on a call. They can’t hear me, and often I can’t hear myself as well as I should. I really thought they would be ok after all the reviews I listened to. My environments are challenging, as in exceptionally noisey while on commute. They do a decent job of cancelling commuter noise when the music is playing but there is plenty of room for improvement. Sound quality is good and base focus is practical for someone like me that wears them in these noisey environments. I even use them mowing the lawn. I use them for 1.5 hours a day. I no like they fold down and are really comfortable. I am not sure if the new design was a good choice ability to fold down is good. I don’t know if I can shell out big cash for an upgrade after the disappointing upgrade from much older noise cancelling Sony XB950N1 headphones. I admit most people won’t challenge the capabilities like I will but come on Sony.",2022-05-13T10:43:00Z,3

I had a pair of the xm4 headphones a couple years ago.  I returned them very quickly.  It was because of how the headphones did fold.  The swivel action of the earcups was something I didn't like at all.  I felt it would be way to easy to accidentally break the headphones.  I very much like that the XM5S do not fold.  I also like that the call quality is much better.  I really like my bose nc700 headphones.  They are great.  I might pick up a pair of these headphones from Ebay.,2022-06-22T23:36:27Z,2

It's all about the price and use, I'm a truck driver and wanted the Bose QC buds for calls but at Verizon I bought a Razer Kishi for gaming and a button fell off on 2nd day. Verizon offered exchange or switch for something else. They had Beats fit pro, buds2, and some other brands. But for Buds2 he made deal of $50 discount and $50 for my exchange Kishi so I only would pay $49. Only offered this deal for Buds2 so easy choice big-time. Phone calls will just have to be short and to the point. What really matters is paying less for a good quality product like Buds2. I got lucky blessed great Verizon service big-time.",2022-03-03T01:24:33Z,3

They fit fantastically, can't fall out, treble & bass are perfectly balanced. Earbuds are good for 10 hours, but case recharges three more times so they technically run 40 hours without being plugged in. Earbuds snap into charging case magnetically. When removed from case, they automatically search for most recent paired item. Listed as 10 feet range but I can put the phone in the center point of my house and listen to music anywhere I go including the upstairs. Only when I go into the garage and shut the steel door do I lose connection. They aren't noise cancelling but they do block sound enough I can hear perfectly fine while driving with normally-annoying road noise. Totally changed driving on long trips. Simple controls on the earbuds allow for volume control, on/off, and I forgot what else.",2022-03-05T06:08:08Z,5

The pixels are lacking in features and functions, that's inevitable since the lower price range but the audio quality is surprisingly great, even compared to the buds pro. The simple strait forward app ui and super simple pairing makes these in my opinion the best $100 buds you can buy. Great lows, mids and crisp highs are great. I am using a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and they just sound great. I do use the paid version of poweramp eq app for better audio control and these buds handle the  Frequencies perfectly.

I have the Bose and the AirPods Max and find the Bose is great for traveling because the AirPods are rather heavy when walking. The Sony set I had exhibited a popping sound in the right ear-cup, rather like an old record might click. I had to return them and never gave them another chance just in case the replacement set had the same problem. The features were very interesting though, especially the ability to use location as a means of changing the noise setting.

My personal favourite set at the minute is the Jabra 85h which shares some of the Sony's ability to change sound profiles. They're also water resistant which is ideal in the UK where rain's so prominently common.",2021-04-22T07:46:28Z,48

It’s hard to find reviews that actually cater to everyone’s views and needs.  For example, I’ve never really heard other reviewers talk about if the pads of lighter headphones actually get dirty.  If you’re commuting to work, and wear makeup (which is not a niche example, like 50% of people do this!) it matters and it’s good to know.  Women wear headphones too and I think many reviewers forget this.  Was wondering if anyone has ever considered comparing these with the sennheiser momentum 3s?  To me the Airpods Max is similar to the sennheisers in build, sound and even weight.  Would be great to have those thoughts too.  But thank you once again for a great review!",2021-04-05T08:20:06Z,17

Probably one of my favorite right now. I have been using the Buds plus for awhile now but these are way more comfortable. I use them for HIIT workout, Boxing and they stay securely in my ears never feeling like they would fall out even with the active movements. They sound terrific (at least to my ears), plenty of bass, good battery life and pairs seamlessly to phone when taken out of the case. The ANC works pretty well for my use case and drowns out most of the surrounding noise. I am overall very happy with these.",2021-01-29T14:36:07Z,63

Airpods pro ear tips makes pain a lot in my right ear canal after about 30 minutes.
I got the Comply foam air tip.Much better for sound isolation than original but is still irritable to the right ear.
Never could sleep with airpods.
On the other hand , all Samsung galaxy buds (original , plus & live) are so convenient.
I listen to the audio while sleeping during night without any difficulty in the morning , specialy when I have galaxy buds live.

My experience: the sound quality crushes the Airpods pro, it sounds much more open and defined with much better bass. However, the ANC and ambient mode is still not on the level of Airpods Pro, it also tends to pick up more wind noise.
In summary I think Galaxy buds pro are the overall better package, you get much better sound quality, much more control with reasonablly effecitive ANC and ambient mode. Fair warning: don't try extra high ambient sound if don't  want to damage your hearing. However, in terms of my favourite sounding earbuds, I would pick the Galaxy buds live. I know they don't block out noise at all, but in terms of sound quality, it's the closest thing I have experienced to a pair of open back headphone.",2021-01-29T15:45:50Z,35

I bought the Galaxy Buds Plus over a year ago and absolutely loved them. Unfortunately I lost one of my buds recently and the ""Find my Buds""  feature on the Wear app could not locate it as if was Disconnected.  So I decided to upgrade and buy the Buds Pro and got them a few days ago as they were on sale.  Right off the bat the first thing I noticed was how they fit in my ear.  They didn't feel as secure as the Plus model and like this review stated, I felt the same way. So I jammed on some tunes and rocked out, bopping my head like a wacked out rocker lol trying to dislodge them and they stayed in place! Second thing I noticed was how much better they sounded vs the Plus. Definitely better lows and mids, and crispier high frequencies. I am experimenting with the EQ and noise cancellation features, as well as different size tips, but so far I am impressed. Just have to get use to how they feel.  Currently trying to figure out how to tap the Buds to manipulate volume, and switch from Ambient to Noise cancellation.  All in all I think it was worth the price jump. But I do want to add one negative thing though. Later in the day I was out doing yardwork in the sun here in sunny California and I was sweating. I was racking leaves and the sweat was starting to get into my ears, and then it happened! One of the earbuds popped out! So, I would go as far to say that you shouldn't do aggressive things when wearing the buds that induces sweat, like mountain biking, or I would even be concerned by jogging. The sweat in the ears will loosen the grip, but then again, larger tips might help, but still, look how much they cost. Good luck!",2021-06-09T16:14:25Z,96

This guy was honest, thorough & on point with everything he said. I bought 2 Samsung S20 FE 5G's today & recieved $700 of instore credit alongside them.. so I grabbed these, some wireless chargers, cases & glass screen protectors.. these earbuds are fantastic. They fit well (I guess I have the ears they were modeled for lol) super crisp highs, immensely clean lows, and the perfect level for mids you can ask for in ear bids. I have owned many truly wireless earbuds, these are the winners over all of the previous ones. Battery life with noise canceling on is half decent, I have not tested them yet without (I will update once I have)

I highly recommend these to anyone on the fence about them. FYI - the 360 Audio feature works on S10 & up. (I confirmed this on my old S10 that I upgraded from 🙂)",2021-06-20T03:32:31Z,9

It has a red filter for the display, which is absolutely crucial for astronomy to protect night vision. My current Apple Watch, if I accidentally tilt my wrist, kills my night vision.

My closest dark sky area is BEAUTIFUL, but has absolutely zero signal of any degree and can be pretty easy to get lost.

Little side note, for my apple watch: I just turn on the 'underwater function' anytime I work out or do other things to turn off my touchscreen.

I’ve been wondering if the Ultra is the right watch for me. I currently have a Apple Watch 6. I do daily runs and workouts, but nothing extreme. My initial reasons for getting the watch are; double battery life, the programmable button to start my workouts, hack split times, etc. Also like that it’ll survive the cold here during Michigan winters and a larger screen for my older eyes. One of the problems with the analogy of “the GoPro of watches” is that unlike my GoPro, I will actually wear it and use it daily. Will i dive 100ft, no. Will I climb mountains and win Ironman contests, no. However, battery life is king, and for me, comparing them to other watches with higher battery life doesn’t work because of all the inter-functionality the Apple watch has with my phone, my iPad, etc which I use for work. I also like the idea of having better coverage since I spend a fair bit of time in city areas. Another reason I found this watch an interesting buy choice is that it’s rugged. I am retired military. I tend to bang-up my watches doing daily things I enjoy. I’ve always had to take off my watch, or constantly worry I will crack the screen, or buy protective covers, etc. Hopefully this watch will be less of a worry for me. Final thought; I tend to get the cheapest Apple watch that provides the functions I need as this technology has been made to constantly change. Why spend 800-900$ on a watch you’re going to replace every year (or three in my case). Yet, even with that concern, I am hoping this iteration of the watch might be “good-enough” for me for at least 5-6 years, which then would justify the cost.",2022-09-22T18:16:52Z,3

After waiting and debating, for well over a year, I'm going to immerse myself even deeper in the Apple Ecosystem and purchase the Series 7 Watch, tomorrow.  
Back when the Series 6 was at the top of the lineup, I was going to make that my first Apple device, but many people told me it wouldn't do me much good, if I didn't have an iPhone.  I purchased my first one, in January.
As much as I love watches, in general, I never liked having one on, all the time.  However, I've done enough research on this Apple Watch to confirm for myself that I will wear it a lot, because of all the conveniences and benefits it brings.  And the larger case and display on the 7 was a major selling point.
Where I'm going to buy it, they only have the silicone-type Sport Bands.  I have large wrists and the band will fit me, but not with any room to spare.  That's my only gripe, but I know I can buy a Sport Loop (Velcro-fasten) band, if I really want that, instead.",2022-03-30T14:04:55Z,29

Second issue is that by getting her the smaller watch, battery life with probably the smallest amount of use is still pretty bad...it regularly drops like 20~ percent within a 3-4 hours being mostly idle and not even having always-on display on or even exercise or anything...just regular texts and some email notifications causes it to lose that much....I have an SE 44mm size and mine lasts a good long day easily.

I recently had the Note 9 and Garmin Fenix 5 Plus Saphire. Apple has won me over with the user friendliness and speed of their products after I’ve resisted the buzz. It seems they surpassed Android/Samsung in functionality and capability around 2015 since they adopted many of the android features in the OS and haven’t looked back since. The only thing I prefer on the Garmin is two week battery life and all of the Series 6 features were available on the Fenix 5 plus years ago. Price point was the same. The sleakness of the apple is great though.,2020-09-20T15:29:10Z,8

The good news here that I can glean is it sounds like a lot of the issues could ber fixed inside the current generation through software enhancements and updates. Of course things like the magnet charger and connection issues are outside that realm (connection maybe not idk) but Google has shown me over the years that they do listen to feedback and will make changes based on reasonable feedback if they're getting a lot of it. I'm more and more dissapointed in what Google ships now-a-days frankly so hopefully they get on the ball with this and don't let it be another flop.,2022-10-17T13:22:05Z,152

I really like this watch, a lot more than I thought I would. Size and battery are the key issues and to a lesser extent, the fitness side. This is my first foray into a genuine smartwatch as opposed to a fitness watch with a little bit of smarts which is what I've been used to with Polar. Ireally  like it and it is definitely a gen 1 product. But I didn't pay anything for it so I don't feel hard done by.

PS I'm not fussed with AOD on it and by turning that off and bedtime mode (agree it makes no sense not to have the same mode as your phone), I've normally got 20% left after 1 day, and that includes if I'm doing a workout for an hour or so.",2022-10-20T16:45:14Z,5

But if you then go to settings you can turn on tilt to wake and battery saving mode is still on. Maybe a little hack to keep the battery lasting longer.,2022-10-18T08:36:12Z,2

Things like this AW Ultra make me think about switching again to iPhone and see if I can get used again to Apple ecosystem.

something like GPS navigation has become essential in my life and something i would incredibly miss from going phoneless. 

I have already began detaching from many social media sites and online activities and trying to focus more on real world experiences, hoping to one day indeed go phoneless and detach from the internet like the old days. but navigation and maps always was a heavy dependence for me. hopefully with the ultra (which i am planning on buying primarily as a fitness tracker within the apple ecosystem) will help me accelerate the detoxing of internet distractions

I recently bought Series 9 Apple watch and having watched this video, tried recording health data such as weight or blood pressure using Siri. It just doesnt work. The access to health option is enabled on both devices and both devices are upgraded to the latest version of their respective OS. Siri's response on the watch was to log the information on the Health app on the phone. Therefore, i called Apple support and they ( after 3 calls) routed me to their Health support team. They explained that this feature is not possible using Siri and as this is a 3rd party video, they cannot advise how did CNET record the health data using Siri.

Could you please explain how did you do it if this is a not something that Siri is able to do?",2024-02-10T16:39:22Z,1

Not even the apple watch after being out for YEARS has 24hr battery life, it has 18hrs.

If you dont like the design, the watch isnt for you, google is trying to stand out, the watch is and will be round for years to come just as the Pixel has had the visor design for 3yrs straight now, its the ""Pixel Look"". They want people to look at your wrist and say ""Thats a Pixel Watch"". I personally will be buying it, the only thing stopping me from buying 1st gen Pixel Watch last year was just that, that it was 1st gen and Ive learned not to buy 1st gen anything as it is a test trial.

It would always keep tracking for a good 10 mins after I got home and sat on the couch. Conversely, when I was walking my dog, it would always end the workout in the <60 seconds it took to wait for her to poop then bag it. I eventually turned off auto detect because of how wildly inconsistent it was. Same for auto pause on runs. I would be actively running and the workout would auto pause and end itself if the GPS lagged and reported me being stationary.",2022-10-19T13:30:56Z,2

1. Real-world battery life and charging. With a battery that maxes out at 24 hours, can I get through a whole day including sleep tracking (assuming no extensive exercise modes)? What's the fastest I can recharge the watch, and can I use my existing qi wireless chargers?
2. Real-world heartrate tracking. I appreciate the emphasis on accuracy from the presentation, but how does it really stack up to other baseline devices?
3. Exercise tracking. I'd love to go on a run without my phone. Does the watch automatically detect when you're exercising and initiate a tracking mode? How accurate is GPS location data when tracking routes? Is there a consistently smooth connection when listening to offline music while exercising (I've been burned by this on older smartwatches)?
4. General software performance and features. Given the older processor (perhaps balanced by the co-processor), how does performance compare to the latest Galaxy Watches? Are there any Pixel phone exclusive features (I don't have a Pixel)?
5. Durability. The screen looks fragile, how easy is it to damage the watch with normal wear and tear? Would you recommend using a case or screen protector?",2022-10-07T13:57:21Z,36

I wear my watch constantly and raising my wrist to see the time is absolutely perfect. I'm coming from the Galaxy Active 2 which was a problem from the start, (VERY short battery life, display phantom triggering amongst other things!), and it recently died on a water therapy session. I reactivated my original galaxy watch in the interim from ordering this one. I personally REALLY like the virtual bezel, my original watch the bezel jammed, unable to move it. It moves now but very tightly, not a good thing. Interesting strap for seniors who's hand mobility is starting to be an issue, I had to put an expandable band on my Galaxy Active 2, and am interested to see how the magnetic latching works.

So far I love it. It really isn't much different than the watch 4. Mainly I'm loving the better battery life I guess mainly do to the bigger battery. It seems to run smoother and faster then the watch 4. However it could be just from being new. I like the bigger size and the build. Feels premium. I do kinda miss the rotating bezel on a premium device but the digital one isn't too bad. Expectly with practice. The new band style is great.  Only issue I see is if u need to do reverse charging from you Galaxy device. The band makes it almost impossible unless you remover it. But again do to the bigger battery you hopefully won't need to charge. A stand would have been nice to sit it on while charging though. Since it doesn't sit flat on a desktop. Overall I'm very happy with it.,2022-08-25T21:41:37Z,52

I had the Watch 3 Classic to Watch 5 Pro and it has noticeably improved battery life  (Always On feature enabled) and more importantly, a working ECG app which was very frustrating to use  on the old one.  It still does not have the Blood Presure and now adding to the list, the skin temperature sensor.

With my unfortunate frustrating experience with Samsung lately, I would recommend the watch if you lower down your expections down to ""As-Is"" from it.  From the beginning, it went downhill, they would not ship it to my work and I end up taking off work abruptly 2-days just to finally receive it at my residence.  The clasp on the Sports D-band that Samsung requires you to bundle to buy broke  within 4 days and both online and onsite local Samsung CSR could not help me.  The former even wants me to ship everything back and order everything back (with no more promotional charging mat) and having to deal with taking off work again just to receive the replacement. It's just the band that's broken!  Grocery shopping is not exactly an extreme sport and yet not a year, not 6-months, not 1-month, not 1-week, but the $40 Samsung band only lasted 4 days.",2022-09-06T05:02:08Z,16

The black rim scratches easily whereas my Frontier S3 looked like new after years of tough use. The sleep function is useless. On most nights there are huge chunks of time it does not record sleep – either at the start, in the middle of the night, or less frequently close to morning. I think I would know if I was awake for 4 hours while in bed! Ironically, my Samsung phone (S21) shows a more accurate number of hours slept, but without the detail the watch is supposed to provide. The Watch 5 Pro also does not accurately record my activity. For example,  on a recent 100km cycle ride I received only 13k steps. The last straw was two days ago when I started the cycling tracker, the timer started but no distance appeared. I tried starting it 3 times and then had to reboot the watch to get it to work. I’m not sure why I continue to wear the watch! I guess it does notify me of texts and I can talk on it if my phone is not nearby. But the watch is a disappointment.

I wish reviewers would touch on maximum power saving battery life. There are probably quite a few of us who don't need to be using all of the features all of the time. We keep it in the absolute minimum state to tell time and receive basic notifications, then turn on GPS, etc when needed.

If I get this watch, I'll make a short video about getting maximum battery life. My ""ancient"" Gear S2 will still go 2-3+ days in power saving mode. I'd imagine the massive battery in the 5 Pro could easily go 4, 5, ...maybe more.",2022-11-16T16:09:38Z,8

There's a modified version that's been being updated for awhile, since the watch 4. It takes a small amount of technical know-how to get it working. But you can use the ECG and Blood Pressure sensors and get the Samsung health Monitor app without a galaxy phone, just for the record. A Google search into this will yield results. That's what I did. I bought this watch not knowing that out-of-the-box you need a galaxy phone to use those and so I was forced to find this workaround.",2022-09-27T09:18:47Z,5

The first concept you describe, the ability to share virtual objects with someone else who is physically in the same room as you, is called World Anchoring, or more specifically sharing world anchors between the two headsets. Essentially both headsets agree on a common world anchor, and place/update all virtual objects accordingly. This is already a thing in the Quest Pro and Quest 3, as well as other higher end headsets like the HoloLens 2 and Magic Leap 2 (similarly priced around $3500-$5000). I’m surprised (but not really) that Apple isn’t on board with this concept right out of the box. 

The next concept, sharing a virtual environment with someone else who’s not co-located with you, just as you said is very straight forward. 

As for remembering unique spaces on the headset, HoloLens came up with a janky-but-effective solution for this years ago (like circa 2016 HoloLens 1 timeframe): HoloLens builds up a spatial map of the room/environment, and remembers the name of the wifi network that it was connected to when it built that map. It then saves that map to its internal memory. The next time the headset connects to the same WiFi network, it recognizes the name, and immediately loads up the pre-built spatial map for that area. This saves on processing power by not having to recreate the spatial map every time the headsets boots up.  HoloLens can remember multiple WiFi signals/spatial maps (they’re on the order of MB of data, so not much compared to its 64GB of onboard memory. 

I’m sure the list could go on. Again, surprised-but-not-surprised that Apple hasn’t figured any of this out yet. 😂",2024-02-14T05:43:46Z,247

Them opting to occlude it is I think more of a settings update that they need to modify. It will track your keyboard orientation and rotation within about 30 degrees off center. You can confirm this by moving the keyboard while the little mini text bar is up.

If Niantic did a genuine collab with them and had a special version of Pokemon Go where instead of using the games interface to see the wild Pokemon nearby they would just. Overlay the Pokemon in your vicinity like actual wild Pokemon. Many years down the line when something like this could become mainstream we can finally experience Pokemon Go like they showed in the original commercials

Even the conveying of the scale of Pokemon could be done so well using this style of device.

You so very clearly relayed the experience and nature of the Vision Pro.  I had absolutely no idea what this gadget was about since I've had very limited exposure to VR but now I get it.  Thank you for the amazing walk-through.,2024-02-13T05:20:31Z,5

I think I would like to shed some light on the matter about what you said about turning the vision pro of. They are actually two buttons on the top of the vision pro which if you click simultaneously the message pops up asking you if you want to turn off or not. So you don't necessarily have to disconnect the power supply,2024-02-10T13:38:55Z,7

I am super interested in the eye alignment and tracking for the device, same for the correction ability/focus. I know prescription lenses can be ordered for the device through Zeiss but I wonder how it will work if you have limited vision, such as people with only one eye (monocular) or if someone has amblyopia (lazy eye). I also wonder how it tracks the eyes if someone has limited eye movements - such as Duanes syndrome/ brown syndrome or other limitations. 
There are already some medical tools that can track the eyes and help measure and diagnose eye alignment issues and I wonder if this device may be even more accurate for that. 
Considering the price tag, perhaps this technology will be easily adopted by the medical industry. Thoughts? 

Of course, then there is the question if long-term use will influence eye health/ myopia development, especially in young children. Would be awesome to get some of the eye care professionals from the dev team to talk about these questions. 
Great content as always! thanks.",2024-01-31T17:15:38Z,1284
