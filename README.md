# Understanding brand Perception of Apple Products through Tech Communities on Youtube


 This project focuses on studying conversations regarding tech products, notable Apple’s, across multiple categories. It hopes to answer questions about the dominating themes on YouTube influencer channels and how consumers perceive Apple’s products compared to competitors, along with what features drive this sentiment. The data collection includes video transcripts and comments from tech influencers on YouTube (MKBHD, Unbox Therapy and CNET), with an emphasis on balanced representation of Apple and competitor products. The findings of this analysis can help Apple and other tech companies in taking decisions around marketing strategies and brand positioning.
